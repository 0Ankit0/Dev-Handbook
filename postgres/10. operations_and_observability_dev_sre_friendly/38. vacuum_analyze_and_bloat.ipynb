    "# Chapter 38: Vacuum, Analyze, and Bloat\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL's Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) architecture provides excellent concurrency semantics without read locks, but it creates a maintenance burden: dead tuple accumulation. Without aggressive maintenance, tables and indexes bloat indefinitely, performance degrades, and the database risks catastrophic transaction ID wraparound failure. This chapter provides the operational knowledge to manage PostgreSQL's vacuum processes effectively, detect bloat before it becomes critical, and remediate existing bloat safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 38.1 MVCC Fundamentals and The Vacuum Imperative\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding why vacuum exists requires understanding PostgreSQL's concurrency model. Unlike databases that use undo logs or read locks, PostgreSQL keeps multiple versions of rows in the table itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.1.1 Tuple Visibility and Row Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "When a row is updated or deleted, PostgreSQL does not immediately remove the old data. Instead, it marks the old row version as \"dead\" and creates a new version with new transaction IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Transaction ID visibility demonstration\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "SELECT txid_current();  -- Returns current transaction ID, e.g., 1500000\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "-- This creates:\n",
    "-- 1. A new row version with xmin = 1500000 (creating transaction)\n",
    "-- 2. The old row marked with xmax = 1500000 (deleting transaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "-- The old row is now \"dead\" - invisible to new transactions but physically remains\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuple Header Fields (Simplified):**\n",
    "- `xmin`: Transaction ID that inserted the row\n",
    "- `xmax`: Transaction ID that deleted/updated the row (0 = live)\n",
    "- `cmin/cmax`: Command ID within transaction\n",
    "- `ctid`: Physical location (block, offset)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Visibility Rule:**\n",
    "A row version is visible to a transaction if:\n",
    "1. `xmin` is committed and less than the querying transaction's ID\n",
    "2. `xmax` is either 0 (not deleted) or a transaction newer than the querying transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.1.2 The Dead Tuple Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Without vacuum, dead tuples accumulate indefinitely:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Simulate bloat generation\n",
    "CREATE TABLE bloat_demo (\n",
    "    id serial PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    data text\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO bloat_demo (data) SELECT 'data' || gs FROM generate_series(1, 100000) gs;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Check live vs dead tuples\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    n_live_tup,\n",
    "    n_dead_tup,\n",
    "    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('bloat_demo')) as total_size\n",
    "FROM pg_stat_user_tables \n",
    "WHERE relname = 'bloat_demo';\n",
    "-- Result: 100000 live, 0 dead, ~4MB\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Generate dead tuples without vacuum\n",
    "UPDATE bloat_demo SET data = data || '_updated';\n",
    "-- Now we have 100000 live + 100000 dead tuples = ~8MB\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE bloat_demo SET data = data || '_again';\n",
    "-- 100000 live + 200000 dead = ~12MB\n",
    "\n",
    "-- This growth continues infinitely without vacuum intervention\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consequences of Unvacuumed Tables:**\n",
    "1. **Storage bloat**: Tables 5x-50x larger than necessary\n",
    "2. **Index bloat**: Indexes point to dead tuples; each update creates new index entries\n",
    "3. **Query slowdown**: Sequential scans read dead tuples; index scans follow pointers to dead rows\n",
    "4. **Transaction ID wraparound**: XID is 32-bit; without freezing, the database stops accepting writes at 2^31 transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.1.3 Vacuum Operations Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL provides three vacuum variants:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standard VACUUM**: Removes dead tuples, updates statistics, marks space for reuse. Does not shrink table files (non-blocking).\n",
    "2. **VACUUM FULL**: Reclaims storage by rewriting the entire table (exclusive locks, requires 2x disk space).\n",
    "3. **ANALYZE**: Updates planner statistics without removing dead tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Standard vacuum (maintenance command, doesn't lock table for reads/writes)\n",
    "VACUUM bloat_demo;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Verbose output (shows details)\n",
    "VACUUM (VERBOSE, ANALYZE) bloat_demo;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Full vacuum (blocking, reclaims disk space)\n",
    "VACUUM FULL bloat_demo;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Analyze only (updates statistics for query planning)\n",
    "ANALYZE bloat_demo;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 38.2 Standard Vacuum Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard vacuum is the workhorse operation. Understanding its phases helps diagnose performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.2.1 Vacuum Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Monitoring vacuum progress (PostgreSQL 12+)\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    pid,\n",
    "    phase,\n",
    "    heap_blks_total,\n",
    "    heap_blks_scanned,\n",
    "    heap_blks_vacuumed,\n",
    "    index_vacuum_count,\n",
    "    dead_tuples,\n",
    "    dead_tuple_bytes,\n",
    "    pg_size_pretty(dead_tuple_bytes) as dead_size\n",
    "FROM pg_stat_progress_vacuum;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase Descriptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **initializing**: Preparing to scan\n",
    "2. **scanning heap**: Reading table blocks sequentially, identifying dead tuples\n",
    "3. **vacuuming indexes**: For each dead tuple found, remove index entries pointing to it (expensive phase)\n",
    "4. **vacuuming heap**: Marking dead tuple space as reusable in the visibility map\n",
    "5. **cleaning up indexes**: Final index cleanup\n",
    "6. **truncating heap**: Attempting to return empty pages at end of file to OS (requires brief lock)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Visibility Map (VM):**\n",
    "PostgreSQL maintains a visibility map (one bit per heap page) indicating whether all tuples on a page are visible to all transactions. Vacuum sets these bits; queries check them to determine if they must check individual tuple visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Visibility map reduces vacuum workload\n",
    "-- Pages marked \"all-visible\" are skipped in future vacuum scans\n",
    "-- Pages marked \"all-frozen\" are skipped in anti-wraparound vacuums\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.2.2 Freezing and Transaction ID Wraparound\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction IDs are 32-bit integers (approx 4 billion). PostgreSQL uses modulo arithmetic, but once XID reaches 2 billion, it risks overlapping with old transactions. Vacuum \"freezes\" tuples by setting special flags, allowing XID reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Check database age (distance to wraparound)\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    datname,\n",
    "    age(datfrozenxid) as xid_age,\n",
    "    2000000000 - age(datfrozenxid) as transactions_until_emergency,\n",
    "    pg_database.datfrozenxid::text\n",
    "FROM pg_database\n",
    "WHERE datallowconn\n",
    "ORDER BY age(datfrozenxid) DESC;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Critical thresholds:\n",
    "-- < 500M: Healthy\n",
    "-- > 1B:  Warning (vacuum working hard)\n",
    "-- > 1.5B: Critical (forced vacuum, performance impact)\n",
    "-- > 2B:  Shutdown (database stops accepting writes)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Freeze Strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eager Freezing** (default aggressive vacuum):\n",
    "   - Tuples frozen when older than `vacuum_freeze_min_age` (50M transactions by default)\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Anti-Wraparound Vacuum**:\n",
    "   - Triggered when table age approaches `autovacuum_freeze_max_age` (200M default)\n",
    "   - Scans entire table regardless of dead tuple count\n",
    "   - Non-blocking but I/O intensive\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Check table-specific freeze ages\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    c.relname,\n",
    "    age(c.relfrozenxid) as table_age,\n",
    "    pg_size_pretty(pg_table_size(c.oid)) as table_size,\n",
    "    s.last_vacuum,\n",
    "    s.last_autovacuum\n",
    "FROM pg_class c\n",
    "JOIN pg_stat_user_tables s ON s.relid = c.oid\n",
    "WHERE c.relkind = 'r'\n",
    "  AND age(c.relfrozenxid) > 100000000  -- Tables older than 100M\n",
    "ORDER BY age(c.relfrozenxid) DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.2.3 Vacuum Cost-Based Delay\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent vacuum from monopolizing I/O, PostgreSQL implements cost-based throttling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```conf\n",
    "vacuum_cost_page_hit = 1        # Cost when page found in buffer cache\n",
    "vacuum_cost_page_miss = 10      # Cost when page read from disk\n",
    "vacuum_cost_page_dirty = 20     # Cost when modified page written back\n",
    "vacuum_cost_limit = 10000       # Cost points before vacuum sleeps\n",
    "vacuum_cost_delay = 0           # Sleep time (0 = no throttling in modern SSDs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation Example:**\n",
    "If `vacuum_cost_limit = 10000` and `vacuum_cost_delay = 2ms`:\n",
    "- Vacuum accumulates cost points during operation\n",
    "- When 10,000 points reached, sleep 2ms\n",
    "- Maximum I/O rate: 10,000 / (2+processing_time) \u2248 5,000 pages/second with 2ms delay\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern SSD Recommendation:**\n",
    "```conf\n",
    "# For SSD storage, reduce or eliminate delay\n",
    "vacuum_cost_delay = 0           # Allow vacuum to run at full speed\n",
    "# OR\n",
    "vacuum_cost_delay = 1ms         # Minimal throttling\n",
    "vacuum_cost_limit = 10000       # Or increase limit to 20000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 38.3 Autovacuum Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "Autovacuum is a background worker system that automates vacuum operations. Proper tuning prevents manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.3.1 Autovacuum Triggering\n",

    "### 38.5.2 VACUUM FULL and Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "**VACUUM FULL** is the nuclear option\u2014it rewrites the table completely, reclaiming all bloat, but requires exclusive locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Standard VACUUM FULL (blocking)\n",
    "VACUUM FULL bloated_table;\n",
    "-- Lock duration: proportional to table size\n",
    "-- Disk space: Requires 2x table size during operation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**pg_repack (Industry Standard Alternative):**\n",
    "`pg_repack` is an extension that performs online table repacking without long exclusive locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Installation\n",
    "pgxn install pg_repack\n",
    "# Or package manager: apt install postgresql-16-repack\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage (creates shadow table, copies data, swaps)\n",
    "pg_repack -d mydb -t bloated_table --no-order\n",
    "\n",
    "# With specific ordering (like CLUSTER but online)\n",
    "pg_repack -d mydb -t large_table -o \"created_at DESC\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How pg_repack works:**\n",
    "1. Creates shadow table with same structure\n",
    "2. Adds trigger to original table to capture changes during copy\n",
    "3. Copies data in batches (non-blocking)\n",
    "4. Applies captured changes\n",
    "5. Swaps tables using exclusive lock (brief, usually milliseconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.5.3 Partitioning as Bloat Prevention\n",
    "\n",
    "For tables with predictable data lifecycles (time-series), partitioning prevents bloat accumulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Instead of deleting old rows (creates dead tuples):\n",
    "DELETE FROM logs WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Use partition dropping:\n",
    "DROP TABLE logs_2023_q1;  -- Instant, no dead tuples, no vacuum needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 38.6 ANALYZE and Statistics Management\n",
    "\n",
    "While vacuum cleans dead tuples, ANALYZE updates the statistics used by the query planner. Stale statistics cause poor execution plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.6.1 How Statistics Work\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- View table statistics\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    attname,\n",
    "    n_distinct,\n",
    "    most_common_vals::text,\n",
    "    most_common_freqs,\n",
    "    histogram_bounds::text\n",
    "FROM pg_stats\n",
    "WHERE tablename = 'users' \n",
    "  AND schemaname = 'public';\n",
    "\n",
    "-- n_distinct: \n",
    "--   >0 = exact count of distinct values\n",
    "--   <0 = fraction of total rows (e.g., -0.5 means 50% distinct)\n",
    "-- most_common_vals: List of most frequent values\n",
    "-- histogram_bounds: Value distribution for range queries\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.6.2 When to Analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **After bulk loads**: COPY or INSERT of >10% of table data\n",
    "2. **After index creation**: Planner needs correlation stats\n",
    "3. **After significant DML**: Large UPDATE/DELETE operations\n",
    "4. **When plans degrade**: Sudden plan changes often indicate stale stats\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Analyze specific columns (faster than full table)\n",
    "ANALYZE users (email, status);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Analyze with sampling (large tables)\n",
    "ANALYZE large_table WITH (SYSTEM, SAMPLING SYSTEM, PERCENT 10);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.6.3 Statistics Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "Increase statistics granularity for columns used in complex WHERE clauses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Default is 100 (number of most_common_vals and histogram buckets)\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN email SET STATISTICS 1000;\n",
    "ANALYZE users;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- This increases accuracy of selectivity estimates for:\n",
    "-- WHERE email = 'specific@value'  (most_common_vals)\n",
    "-- WHERE email BETWEEN 'a' AND 'b'  (histogram_bounds)\n",

    "SELECT datname, age(datfrozenxid) FROM pg_database \n",
    "WHERE age(datfrozenxid) > 500000000;\n",

    "### 38.7.3 Monthly/Quarterly\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Index maintenance**: REINDEX CONCURRENTLY on heavily updated indexes\n",
    "2. **Statistics refresh**: Increase statistics targets on problem columns\n",
    "3. **Partition management**: Drop old partitions, create new ones\n",
    "4. **Vacuum Full assessment**: For non-partitioned tables with >50% bloat that can't be repacked\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MVCC Fundamentals**: PostgreSQL keeps old row versions in the table until vacuum removes them. Transaction IDs determine visibility, and the 32-bit XID space requires periodic \"freezing\" of old tuples to prevent wraparound shutdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vacuum Mechanics**: Standard vacuum scans tables to identify dead tuples, removes index entries pointing to them, marks space as reusable, and updates the visibility map. It runs non-blocking but requires cleanup of indexes (the expensive phase).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Autovacuum Tuning**: Default `scale_factor` settings (20%) are inappropriate for large tables. Configure per-table thresholds (`scale_factor = 0`, absolute thresholds) for tables >10GB. Increase `autovacuum_max_workers` to 4-6 on busy systems and reduce `vacuum_cost_delay` for SSD storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bloat Detection**: Use `pgstattuple` for accurate measurements or statistical estimation queries for monitoring. Watch for dead tuple ratios >20% or tables approaching transaction ID age limits (1.5B transactions).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Remediation**: Use manual `VACUUM (FREEZE)` for urgent cleanup, `pg_repack` for online bloat removal without downtime, and `VACUUM FULL` only as last resort (requires exclusive lock). For time-series data, use partitioning and DROP instead of DELETE to avoid bloat entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **ANALYZE Importance**: Statistics determine query plans. Analyze after bulk loads and set higher statistics targets (ALTER TABLE ... SET STATISTICS) for columns with skewed distributions or complex filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Monitoring**: Track `pg_stat_user_tables` for dead/live tuple ratios, `pg_stat_progress_vacuum` for active vacuum phases, and `age(datfrozenxid)` for wraparound prevention. Terminate long-running transactions that block vacuum progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 39, we will explore Monitoring and Diagnostics\u2014covering the essential metrics to watch (latency, locks, WAL, vacuum), slow query logging and sampling approaches, useful system views (`pg_stat_*`), and investigation workflows for production incidents."
