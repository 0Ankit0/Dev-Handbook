    "# Chapter 19: Transactions and MVCC\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL's Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) provides high concurrency without excessive locking, but introduces complexity around visibility, isolation, and resource management. This chapter explains how PostgreSQL handles concurrent data modifications, the practical implications of isolation levels, and patterns for maintaining correctness under load.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19.1 MVCC Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike databases that use read locks, PostgreSQL maintains multiple versions of rows to allow readers and writers to proceed without blocking each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.1.1 Row Versioning and System Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Every PostgreSQL table has hidden system columns:\n",
    "-- xmin: Transaction ID that inserted this row version\n",
    "-- xmax: Transaction ID that deleted/updated this row (0 = active)\n",
    "-- cmin/cmax: Command ID within transaction\n",
    "-- ctid: Physical location (block, offset) - changes after VACUUM FULL\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Viewing row versions (requires superuser or specific permissions):\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    xmin, \n",
    "    xmax, \n",
    "    ctid, \n",
    "    user_id, \n",
    "    email, \n",
    "    status \n",
    "FROM users \n",
    "WHERE user_id = 123;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Example output:\n",
    "-- xmin   | xmax | ctid   | user_id | email      | status\n",
    "-- 452001 | 0    | (0,15) | 123     | alice@...  | active\n",
    "-- 452001 = Inserted by transaction 452001\n",
    "-- 0      = Not deleted (active version)\n",
    "-- (0,15) = Block 0, offset 15\n",
    "\n",
    "-- When a row is updated, PostgreSQL creates a new version:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "UPDATE users SET status = 'inactive' WHERE user_id = 123;\n",
    "-- Creates new row version with:\n",
    "--   xmin = current_transaction_id (e.g., 452100)\n",
    "--   xmax = 0\n",
    "-- Old version updated:\n",
    "--   xmax = 452100 (marking it deleted by transaction 452100)\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Now querying:\n",
    "SELECT xmin, xmax, ctid, status FROM users WHERE user_id = 123;\n",
    "-- New version: xmin=452100, xmax=0, ctid=(0,16), status='inactive'\n",
    "-- Old version still exists on disk: xmin=452001, xmax=452100\n",
    "-- Old version is \"dead\" but remains until VACUUM removes it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.1.2 The Visibility Check\n",
    "\n",
    "When a transaction queries data, PostgreSQL applies visibility rules to determine which row versions are visible:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Visibility logic (simplified):\n",
    "-- 1. Row is visible if:\n",
    "--    a) xmin is committed AND xmin < transaction's snapshot xid\n",
    "--    b) xmax is 0 OR xmax is aborted OR xmax > transaction's snapshot xid\n",
    "-- 2. Row is invisible (deleted) if:\n",
    "--    a) xmax is committed AND xmax < transaction's snapshot xid\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Practical demonstration:\n",
    "-- Session A (Transaction 1):\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "SELECT txid_current();  -- Returns 100\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = 900 WHERE id = 1;  -- Was 1000\n",
    "-- Does not commit yet\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session B (Transaction 2):\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "SELECT txid_current();  -- Returns 101\n",
    "SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;  -- Sees 1000 (old version)\n",
    "-- Why? Transaction 100 is not committed yet, so its changes are invisible\n",
    "-- Session B sees the version where xmax=0 or xmax > 101\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session A commits:\n",
    "COMMIT;  -- Transaction 100 commits\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session B (still in transaction 101):\n",
    "SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;  -- Still sees 1000!\n",
    "-- Why? Session B's snapshot was taken at BEGIN, showing committed transactions as of that moment\n",
    "-- Transaction 100 committed after 101 started, but 101 doesn't see it yet\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session B commits and starts new transaction:\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;  -- Now sees 900\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19.2 Transaction Isolation Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL standard defines four isolation levels. PostgreSQL implements three (Read Uncommitted behaves like Read Committed).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.2.1 Read Committed (Default)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Default isolation level\n",
    "-- Behavior:\n",
    "-- 1. Each statement sees a fresh snapshot (committed data as of statement start)\n",
    "-- 2. Within a transaction, subsequent statements may see newer committed data\n",
    "-- 3. UPDATE/DELETE only see target rows committed as of statement start\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Demonstration of statement-level consistency:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "-- Statement 1:\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending';  -- Returns 50\n",
    "-- Meanwhile, another session commits 10 new pending orders\n",
    "-- Statement 2 (same transaction):\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending';  -- Returns 60!\n",
    "-- Different statements see different snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Demonstration of concurrent update behavior:\n",
    "-- Session A:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;  -- Balance was 1000\n",
    "-- Now has lock on row id=1, balance pending 900\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session B (concurrent):\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;  -- Blocked!\n",
    "-- Waits for Session A's lock\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session A commits:\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session B unblocks:\n",
    "-- PostgreSQL re-evaluates WHERE clause with fresh snapshot\n",
    "-- Sees balance is now 900 (Session A committed)\n",
    "-- Applies update: 900 - 100 = 800\n",
    "UPDATE returns \"UPDATE 1\" (success, not lost update)\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "-- Final balance: 800 (correct)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- However, Read Committed allows non-repeatable reads:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;  -- Returns 800\n",
    "-- Session B updates balance to 700 and commits\n",
    "SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;  -- Returns 700 (different!)\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.2.2 Repeatable Read\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;\n",
    "-- Behavior:\n",
    "-- 1. Single snapshot for entire transaction (taken at first statement)\n",
    "-- 2. Subsequent statements see same data as first statement\n",
    "-- 3. Prevents non-repeatable reads and phantom reads (in PostgreSQL)\n",
    "-- 4. Serialization failures possible (must retry)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Preventing non-repeatable reads:\n",
    "BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;\n",

    "\n",

    "COMMIT;  \n",
    "-- ERROR: could not serialize access due to read/write dependencies\n",
    "-- DETAIL: Reason code: Canceled on identification as a pivot, during commit attempt\n",
    "-- Session B must retry\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Serializable uses predicate locking (less granular than row locking)\n",
    "-- Higher overhead than Repeatable Read, but guarantees correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Practical usage:\n",
    "-- Financial transfers where consistency across multiple rows is critical\n",
    "-- Inventory allocation where sum constraints matter\n",
    "-- Generally: Use explicit locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE) instead for better performance\n",

    "\n",
    "Understanding specific anomalies helps select appropriate mitigation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.3.1 Lost Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Lost Update: Two transactions read same value, both update based on it, second overwrites first\n",
    "-- Example: Counter increment\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session A:\n",

    "### 19.3.2 Phantom Reads vs MVCC\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Phantom Read: Query returns different set of rows on re-execution due to inserts\n",

    "-- Session A checks: SELECT 1 FROM accounts WHERE email = 'new@example.com' (no rows)\n",
    "-- Session B inserts 'new@example.com' and commits\n",
    "-- Session A tries: INSERT INTO accounts (email) VALUES ('new@example.com')\n",
    "-- Result: Unique violation (not a phantom read, but a conflict)\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MVCC Architecture**: PostgreSQL maintains multiple row versions using `xmin` (inserting transaction) and `xmax` (deleting transaction) system columns. Readers never block writers; each transaction sees a snapshot of committed data as of statement or transaction start.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Isolation Levels**: Read Committed (default) provides statement-level consistency with automatic re-evaluation of UPDATE WHERE clauses to prevent lost updates. Repeatable Read provides transaction-level snapshot consistency but allows write skew anomalies. Serializable prevents all anomalies including write skew through predicate locking but requires application retry logic for serialization failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Write Skew**: Occurs when concurrent transactions read overlapping data sets, each makes decisions based on that data, and then write to disjoint rows, violating constraints. Prevent with explicit locking (`SELECT FOR UPDATE`), advisory locks, or Serializable isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transaction Boundaries**: Keep transactions short; never hold transactions open during user interaction or network calls. Use explicit transactions (`BEGIN...COMMIT`) for multi-statement atomicity. Avoid \"idle in transaction\" states through connection pool configuration and `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Locking**: Use row-level locks (`FOR UPDATE`, `FOR SHARE`) for pessimistic concurrency control. `SKIP LOCKED` enables efficient queue processing. Deadlocks occur with inconsistent lock ordering; applications must implement retry logic. Advisory locks provide application-level synchronization without database row contention.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Long Transaction Impact**: Transactions prevent vacuum from removing dead tuples, causing table and index bloat. Monitor `pg_stat_activity` for `xid_age` and `idle in transaction` states. Tables near XID wraparound (2 billion limit) require urgent vacuuming; configure autovacuum aggressively for high-churn tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 20, we will explore Locking Deep Dive\u2014covering explicit locking strategies, advisory locks, deadlock detection and resolution, and optimistic vs pessimistic concurrency control patterns for high-throughput systems."
