    "# Chapter 20: Isolation Levels and Locking\n",
    "\n",
    "While MVCC eliminates read locks, write operations and explicit locking remain essential for consistency. This chapter provides a comprehensive examination of PostgreSQL's locking infrastructure, from lightweight row locks to application-level advisory locks, with practical patterns for deadlock avoidance and concurrency control in high-contention environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.1 Lock Hierarchy and Granularity\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL implements multiple lock levels that operate at different granularities, from entire tables to individual rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.1.1 Table-Level Lock Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- PostgreSQL has 8 table-level lock modes, ordered from least to most restrictive:\n",
    "\n",
    "-- 1. ACCESS SHARE (SELECT)\n",
    "-- 2. ROW SHARE (SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE)\n",
    "-- 3. ROW EXCLUSIVE (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)\n",
    "-- 4. SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE (VACUUM, ANALYZE, CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY)\n",
    "-- 5. SHARE (CREATE INDEX)\n",
    "-- 6. SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE (ALTER TABLE, triggers)\n",
    "-- 7. EXCLUSIVE (REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY)\n",
    "-- 8. ACCESS EXCLUSIVE (DROP TABLE, ALTER TABLE, VACUUM FULL, LOCK TABLE)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Conflict matrix (simplified):\n",
    "-- ACCESS SHARE conflicts with: ACCESS EXCLUSIVE\n",
    "-- ROW SHARE conflicts with: EXCLUSIVE, ACCESS EXCLUSIVE  \n",
    "-- ROW EXCLUSIVE conflicts with: SHARE, SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE, EXCLUSIVE, ACCESS EXCLUSIVE\n",
    "-- SHARE conflicts with: ROW EXCLUSIVE, SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE, SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE, EXCLUSIVE, ACCESS EXCLUSIVE\n",
    "-- ACCESS EXCLUSIVE conflicts with: All other locks\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Explicit table locking:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "LOCK TABLE orders IN SHARE MODE;\n",
    "-- Now other transactions can read but cannot modify rows until commit\n",
    "-- Useful for bulk operations requiring stable view\n",
    "\n",
    "-- ACCESS EXCLUSIVE (most restrictive):\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "LOCK TABLE orders IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE;\n",
    "-- Blocks all access including SELECT\n",
    "-- Use only for DDL operations or maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Check current table locks:\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    l.locktype,\n",
    "    l.relation::regclass as table_name,\n",
    "    l.mode,\n",
    "    l.granted,\n",
    "    a.usename,\n",
    "    a.application_name,\n",
    "    left(a.query, 50) as query_snippet\n",
    "FROM pg_locks l\n",
    "JOIN pg_stat_activity a ON l.pid = a.pid\n",
    "WHERE l.locktype = 'relation'\n",
    "  AND l.relation::regclass::text = 'orders';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.1.2 Row-Level Locking Internals\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Row locks are stored in the row header (t_infomask bits), not a separate lock table\n",
    "-- Types: FOR UPDATE, FOR NO KEY UPDATE, FOR SHARE, FOR KEY SHARE\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Demonstration of lock strength:\n",
    "-- Session A:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;\n",
    "-- Sets exclusive lock on row 1\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session B attempts:\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;  -- Blocks\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1 FOR NO KEY UPDATE;  -- Blocks  \n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1 FOR SHARE;  -- Blocks\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1 FOR KEY SHARE;  -- Blocks\n",
    "UPDATE users SET name = 'X' WHERE user_id = 1;  -- Blocks\n",
    "DELETE FROM users WHERE user_id = 1;  -- Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Lock compatibility matrix:\n",
    "-- FOR KEY SHARE: Blocks FOR UPDATE, FOR NO KEY UPDATE\n",
    "-- FOR SHARE: Blocks FOR UPDATE, FOR NO KEY UPDATE  \n",
    "-- FOR NO KEY UPDATE: Blocks FOR UPDATE, FOR NO KEY UPDATE, FOR SHARE\n",
    "-- FOR UPDATE: Blocks all row locks and writes\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Practical difference between FOR UPDATE and FOR NO KEY UPDATE:\n",
    "-- FOR UPDATE: Strongest, used when deleting or updating primary key\n",
    "-- FOR NO KEY UPDATE: Used for standard updates (doesn't block FOR KEY SHARE)\n",
    "-- This distinction matters for foreign key checks (which use FOR KEY SHARE)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Example: Parent/child with FK\n",
    "-- Updating parent primary key requires FOR UPDATE (blocks FK checks)\n",
    "-- Updating non-key column uses FOR NO KEY UPDATE (allows FK checks to proceed)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.2 Deadlock Detection and Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks are inevitable in concurrent systems; PostgreSQL detects and resolves them automatically, but application design must minimize their occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.2.1 How Deadlock Detection Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- PostgreSQL checks for deadlocks every deadlock_timeout (default 1s)\n",
    "-- When detected, one transaction is aborted with error code 40P01\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Creating a deliberate deadlock:\n",
    "-- Session A:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = 900 WHERE id = 1;  -- Locks row 1\n",
    "-- ... wait ...\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session B:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = 800 WHERE id = 2;  -- Locks row 2\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = 800 WHERE id = 1;  -- Waits for Session A (row 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session A continues:\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = 900 WHERE id = 2;  -- Waits for Session B (row 2)\n",
    "-- DEADLOCK DETECTED\n",
    "-- ERROR: deadlock detected\n",
    "-- DETAIL: Process 12345 waits for ShareLock on transaction 67890; blocked by process 12346.\n",
    "-- HINT: See server log for query details.\n",
    "-- CONTEXT: while updating tuple (0,1) in relation \"accounts\"\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session A is aborted (ROLLBACK), Session B proceeds\n",
    "-- Which transaction is aborted? PostgreSQL chooses the one with:\n",
    "-- 1. Fewer locks held (less work to undo)\n",
    "-- 2. If equal, random selection\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.2.2 Deadlock Prevention Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Pattern 1: Consistent Ordering (most important)\n",
    "-- Always acquire locks in the same order (e.g., by primary key ascending)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Bad (potential deadlock):\n",
    "-- Transfer A->B: Lock A, then B\n",
    "-- Transfer B->A: Lock B, then A\n",
    "-- If both happen concurrently: deadlock\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Good (deadlock-free):\n",
    "-- Always lock lower ID first\n",
    "-- Transfer A->B (A=1, B=2): Lock 1, then 2\n",
    "-- Transfer B->A (B=2, A=1): Lock 1 (A), then 2 (B)\n",
    "-- Same order = no circular wait\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Implementation:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "-- Sort IDs to ensure consistent locking order\n",
    "SELECT * FROM accounts \n",
    "WHERE id IN (LEAST($1, $2), GREATEST($1, $2)) \n",
    "ORDER BY id \n",
    "FOR UPDATE;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Pattern 2: Two-Phase Locking with Retry\n",
    "-- Application code structure:\n",
    "/*\n",
    "def transfer_funds(from_id, to_id, amount, max_retries=3):\n",
    "    for attempt in range(max_retries):\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            with db.transaction():\n",
    "                # Lock both rows in consistent order\n",
    "                rows = db.query(\n",
    "                    \"SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id IN (%s, %s) ORDER BY id FOR UPDATE\",\n",
    "                    min(from_id, to_id), max(from_id, to_id)\n",
    "                )\n",
    "                # Verify balances, update both\n",
    "                db.execute(\"UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - %s WHERE id = %s\", amount, from_id)\n",
    "                db.execute(\"UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + %s WHERE id = %s\", amount, to_id)\n",
    "                return True\n",
    "        except DeadlockDetected:\n",
    "            if attempt == max_retries - 1:\n",
    "                raise\n",
    "            time.sleep(random.uniform(0.01, 0.1))  # Exponential backoff\n",
    "*/\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Pattern 3: Reduce Lock Contention (optimistic locking)\n",
    "-- Instead of SELECT FOR UPDATE, use version checking:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "SELECT balance, version FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "-- Application calculates: new_balance = balance - 100\n",
    "UPDATE accounts \n",
    "SET balance = balance - 100, version = version + 1 \n",
    "WHERE id = 1 AND version = :previous_version;\n",
    "-- If rows affected = 0, another transaction modified the row (retry)\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "-- No explicit lock held during calculation, shorter critical section\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.3 Advisory Locks\n",
    "\n",
    "Advisory locks provide application-level synchronization without consuming table rows, ideal for coordinating external processes or complex business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.3.1 Session vs Transaction Advisory Locks\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Two scopes:\n",
    "-- 1. Session-level: Released when session disconnects (or explicit unlock)\n",
    "-- 2. Transaction-level: Released at transaction commit/rollback (preferred)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Transaction-level (automatic cleanup):\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(123);  -- Lock ID 123\n",
    "-- ... critical section ...\n",
    "COMMIT;  -- Lock automatically released\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Session-level (manual management):\n",
    "SELECT pg_advisory_lock(456);  -- Acquire\n",
    "-- ... work ...\n",
    "SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(456);  -- Must release manually\n",
    "-- If session dies, lock is released (cleanup on disconnect)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Try-lock (non-blocking):\n",
    "SELECT pg_advisory_try_xact_lock(789);\n",
    "-- Returns true if acquired, false if already held by another session\n",
    "-- Use for optional work: \"if nobody else is doing this, I'll do it\"\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Multiple locks:\n",
    "SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(1), pg_advisory_xact_lock(2);\n",
    "-- Acquires both (order matters for deadlock prevention!)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Lock IDs:\n",
    "-- Use 64-bit integers (or two 32-bit)\n",
    "-- Convention: Hash of resource type + ID\n",
    "-- Example: pg_advisory_xact_lock('myapp:job:' || job_id)::bigint - hash to int\n",
    "-- Or use two int keys: pg_advisory_xact_lock(resource_type_id, resource_id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.3.2 Practical Advisory Lock Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Pattern 1: Queue Processing (Singleton Workers)\n",
    "-- Ensure only one worker processes a queue at a time:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock('global_queue_processor'::regclass::oid::int);\n",
    "-- Check if already processing, if not:\n",
    "UPDATE jobs SET status = 'processing' WHERE status = 'pending' LIMIT 1;\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Pattern 2: Unique Job Execution (prevent duplicate cron jobs)\n",
    "-- Cron runs every minute, but job might take 5 minutes:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "-- Try to acquire lock for this specific job type\n",
    "IF pg_advisory_try_xact_lock('daily_report_job') THEN\n",
    "    -- Execute report generation (takes 5 minutes)\n",
    "    PERFORM generate_daily_report();\n",
    "    COMMIT;\n",
    "    -- Lock held for duration, next cron sees lock busy and skips\n",
    "ELSE\n",
    "    ROLLBACK;\n",
    "    -- Another instance is running, exit silently\n",
    "END IF;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Pattern 3: External Resource Coordination\n",
    "-- Coordinate with external API rate limits:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "-- Lock based on API endpoint hash\n",
    "SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('stripe_api_charge'));\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lock Hierarchy**: PostgreSQL uses table-level locks (8 modes from ACCESS SHARE to ACCESS EXCLUSIVE) for DDL and bulk operations, and row-level locks (FOR KEY SHARE, FOR SHARE, FOR NO KEY UPDATE, FOR UPDATE) for DML. Row locks are stored in tuple headers, not a separate lock table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deadlock Management**: Deadlocks are detected via wait-for graph analysis every `deadlock_timeout` (default 1s). Prevention requires consistent lock acquisition ordering (always lock resources in the same sequence, e.g., by ID ascending). Applications must implement exponential backoff retry logic for deadlock and serialization failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advisory Locks**: Application-level synchronization using 64-bit integer identifiers. Transaction-level advisory locks (`pg_advisory_xact_lock`) automatically release at commit/rollback, preventing lock leaks. Ideal for queue singletons, cron job coordination, and external API rate limiting without blocking table access.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Concurrency Strategies**: Pessimistic locking (`SELECT FOR UPDATE`) guarantees consistency by blocking conflicts, suitable for high-contention financial operations but reduces throughput. Optimistic locking uses version columns to detect conflicts at write time, better for read-heavy workloads but requires application retry logic. Hybrid approaches minimize lock duration by using optimistic checks for reads and pessimistic locks only for critical writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Serialization Handling**: Serializable isolation prevents all anomalies including write skew through predicate locking, but requires mandatory retry logic for serialization failures. High retry rates (>5%) indicate excessive contention requiring transaction scope reduction or access pattern partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Monitoring**: `pg_locks` joined with `pg_stat_activity` reveals blocking queries. \"Idle in transaction\" states holding locks are critical performance killers. AccessExclusiveLock on production tables indicates DDL operations blocking all access. Foreign keys without indexes cause table scans during parent updates/deletes, extending lock duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 21, we will explore Sequences and ID Generation\u2014covering SERIAL vs IDENTITY, sequence caching, UUID strategies, and distributed ID generation patterns for high-throughput systems."
