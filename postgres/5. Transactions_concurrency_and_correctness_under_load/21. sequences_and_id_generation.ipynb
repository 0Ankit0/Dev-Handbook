    "# Chapter 21: Sequences and ID Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliable, high-performance ID generation is foundational to database applications. This chapter examines PostgreSQL's sequence infrastructure, contrasts legacy and modern approaches to surrogate key generation, and addresses distributed system challenges including the trade-offs between sequential and random identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 21.1 Sequence Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences are database objects that generate unique integer values according to defined rules, providing the mechanism behind auto-incrementing columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 21.1.1 Sequence Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Creating a standalone sequence (uncommon but illustrative)\n",
    "CREATE SEQUENCE order_id_seq\n",
    "    AS BIGINT  -- Default is BIGINT since PostgreSQL 10\n",
    "    START WITH 1\n",
    "    INCREMENT BY 1\n",
    "    NO MINVALUE\n",
    "    NO MAXVALUE\n",
    "    CACHE 1;  -- Default cache size\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Sequence functions:\n",
    "SELECT nextval('order_id_seq');  -- Returns next value (1, then 2, then 3...)\n",
    "SELECT currval('order_id_seq');  -- Returns current session's last value\n",
    "SELECT lastval();                -- Returns last value from any sequence in session\n",
    "SELECT setval('order_id_seq', 1000);  -- Set current value (dangerous, use carefully)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- How sequences work internally:\n",
    "-- 1. Sequences are stored in a single row in pg_sequence catalog\n",
    "-- 2. Next value is calculated: current_value + increment\n",
    "-- 3. Changes are WAL-logged (durable) but not transactional (rolled back values are lost)\n",
    "-- 4. Current value is cached in backend memory for performance\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Demonstrating non-transactional behavior:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "SELECT nextval('order_id_seq');  -- Returns 1\n",
    "SELECT nextval('order_id_seq');  -- Returns 2\n",
    "ROLLBACK;\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT nextval('order_id_seq');  -- Returns 3! (1 and 2 are lost forever)\n",
    "-- This is by design: sequences guarantee uniqueness, not gap-free allocation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 21.1.2 Sequence Durability and Caching\n",

    "-- CACHE 100: ~500,000 IDs/sec (minimal catalog contention)\n",
    "-- CACHE 1000: ~2,000,000 IDs/sec (scales with connection pooling)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Important caveats with CACHE > 1:\n",
    "-- 1. Sequences are not strictly monotonic across sessions\n",
    "--    Session A gets 1-1000, Session B gets 1001-2000\n",
    "--    If A crashes, 1-1000 might never be used (gaps)\n",

    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL offers two auto-increment mechanisms. IDENTITY (SQL standard) is the modern preference over the legacy SERIAL type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 21.2.1 The Legacy SERIAL Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Old approach (still widely used, but not recommended):\n",

    "\n",
    "-- What SERIAL actually does:\n",
    "-- 1. CREATE SEQUENCE orders_order_id_seq\n",
    "-- 2. ALTER TABLE orders ALTER order_id SET DEFAULT nextval('orders_order_id_seq')\n",
    "-- 3. ALTER SEQUENCE orders_order_id_seq OWNED BY orders.order_id\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Problems with SERIAL:\n",
    "-- 1. Implicit sequence creation (magic behavior, hard to introspect)\n",
    "-- 2. Sequence name derived from table/column names (brittle with renames)\n",
    "-- 3. Privilege inheritance issues (sequence permissions separate from table)\n",
    "-- 4. No standard SQL compliance\n",
    "-- 5. Dropping column doesn't drop sequence automatically (orphaned sequences)\n",

    "-- Example of SERIAL fragility:\n",

    "INSERT INTO events_distributed VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), '{\"key\": \"value\"}');\n",
    "-- Pros: No coordination needed, impossible to guess\n",
    "-- Cons: Completely random = maximum B-tree page splitting, fragmentation\n",

    "-- Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-- 1. Use BIGINT for single-database systems (best performance)\n",
    "-- Only use UUID if distributed/multi-master required\n",
    "\n",
    "-- 2. Sequential UUIDs (v7 or custom \"COMB\"):\n",
    "-- If using UUID, ensure time-ordered prefix\n",
    "-- Example: UUID with first 6 bytes as timestamp\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequence Architecture**: Sequences provide unique integer values via `nextval()`, cached in memory for performance. They are non-transactional (rolled back values are lost), ensuring uniqueness at the cost of gaps. The `CACHE` parameter is critical for high-throughput systems—values of 1000+ reduce catalog contention to millions of IDs per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **IDENTITY vs SERIAL**: `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` (PostgreSQL 10+) is the SQL-standard replacement for SERIAL. It provides better ownership semantics (dropping columns drops sequences), survives renames, handles privileges correctly, and supports `OVERRIDING SYSTEM VALUE` for data migration. Never use SERIAL for new designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **UUID Performance**: UUID v4 (random) causes severe B-tree fragmentation due to random insertion order. Use UUID v7 (time-ordered) or 64-bit alternatives (Snowflake) for distributed systems. If UUID is required for business reasons but performance matters, use a BIGINT surrogate primary key for clustering while maintaining a separate UUID unique index.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Distributed ID Generation**: Snowflake IDs (64-bit time-ordered) provide 4096 IDs/millisecond per machine without database coordination. The Hi/Lo algorithm batches sequence allocation in application memory to reduce round-trips. COMB GUIDs modify UUIDs to have time-ordered prefixes for better index locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Anti-Patterns**: Never use `MAX(id)+1` (race conditions and serialization bottlenecks). Never use timestamps alone as primary keys (clock collisions). Monitor INTEGER sequences for overflow (use BIGINT for high-volume tables). Accept that gaps are inevitable and do not attempt \"gap-free\" sequences (extreme performance penalty).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 22, we will explore SQL Functions and Procedures—covering creation of immutable, stable, and volatile functions, security definer patterns, and when to use SQL vs PL/pgSQL for database logic."
