    "# Chapter 42: Full-Text Search\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL's Full-Text Search (FTS) capability extends far beyond the simplistic `LIKE '%term%'` pattern matching that crushes performance on large datasets. By implementing linguistic analysis, stemming, ranking algorithms, and relevance scoring directly in the database engine, PostgreSQL eliminates network round-trips to external search services for many use cases. However, effective deployment requires understanding text search configurations, vectorization strategies, and the architectural boundaries where dedicated search engines become necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 42.1 FTS Architecture and Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Full-text search in PostgreSQL operates on a fundamentally different paradigm than substring matching. It transforms natural language into normalized lexemes and builds inverted indexes for rapid retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 42.1.1 Documents and Lexemes\n",
    "\n",
    "A **document** is the unit of search—typically a concatenation of fields that constitute a searchable corpus. A **lexeme** is a normalized word form after linguistic processing (stemming, stopword removal).\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Basic vectorization\n",
    "SELECT to_tsvector('english', 'The quick brown foxes jumped over the lazy dogs');\n",
    "-- Returns: 'brown':3 'dog':9 'fox':4 'jump':6 'lazi':8 'quick':2\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Note the transformations:\n",
    "-- 1. Stop words removed ('the', 'over')\n",
    "-- 2. Stemming applied ('foxes' -> 'fox', 'jumped' -> 'jump', 'lazy' -> 'lazi')\n",
    "-- 3. Position information preserved (numbers indicate word positions)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**tsvector Structure**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Anatomy of a tsvector\n",
    "SELECT to_tsvector('english', 'PostgreSQL is a powerful database');\n",
    "-- 'database':5 'power':4 'postgresql':1\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Format: 'lexeme':position[,position...][weight]\n",
    "-- Weights: A (title), B (subtitle), C (body), D (meta) - default is D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 42.1.2 The tsquery Type\n",
    "\n",
    "While `tsvector` represents the document, `tsquery` represents the search predicate with Boolean operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Basic query construction\n",
    "SELECT to_tsquery('english', 'postgresql & database');\n",
    "-- Returns: 'postgresql' & 'database'\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Phrase search (order matters)\n",
    "SELECT to_tsquery('english', 'postgresql <-> database');\n",
    "-- <-> is \"followed by\" (adjacent positions)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Complex Boolean logic\n",
    "SELECT to_tsquery('english', '(quick | fast) & (fox | wolf) & !dog');\n",
    "-- Returns: ('quick' | 'fast') & ('fox' | 'wolf') & !'dog'\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Prefix matching\n",
    "SELECT to_tsquery('english', 'postgres:*');\n",
    "-- Matches 'postgresql', 'postgres', 'postgraduate' (stemmed variations)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query Operators**:\n",
    "- `&` : AND (both terms must exist)\n",
    "- `|` : OR (either term)\n",
    "- `!` : NOT (exclude term)\n",
    "- `<->` : Followed by (distance of 1)\n",
    "- `<N>` : Distance operator (within N words)\n",
    "- `:*` : Prefix matching\n",
    "\n",
    "## 42.2 Text Search Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "Configurations determine how raw text transforms into tsvectors through parsing and dictionary processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 42.2.1 Built-in Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Available configurations\n",
    "SELECT cfgname FROM pg_ts_config;\n",
    "-- Common: english, spanish, french, german, simple\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Examine configuration components\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    cfgname,\n",
    "    prs_name as parser,\n",
    "    dict_name as dictionaries\n",
    "FROM pg_ts_config c\n",
    "JOIN pg_ts_config_map m ON m.map_cfg = c.oid\n",
    "JOIN pg_ts_parser p ON c.cfgparser = p.oid\n",
    "JOIN pg_ts_dict d ON m.map_dict = d.oid\n",
    "WHERE cfgname = 'english'\n",
    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parser Functions**:\n",
    "The parser breaks text into tokens (words, numbers, email addresses, URLs, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- See how parser tokenizes text\n",
    "SELECT * FROM ts_parse('default', 'foo-bar@example.com https://postgresql.org 12345');\n",
    "-- tokid | token              | description\n",
    "-- 1     | foo-bar@example.com| Protocol/email\n",
    "-- 12    | https              | Protocol head\n",
    "-- 12    | postgresql.org     | Host\n",
    "-- 12    | 12345              | Integer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 42.2.2 Dictionary Processing and Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries process tokens to produce lexemes. The default `english` configuration uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ispell** or **simple** dictionary for spell checking\n",
    "2. **english_stem** (Snowball stemming algorithm)\n",
    "3. **stop words** removal\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- View English stop words\n",
    "SELECT * FROM pg_get_keywords() \n",
    "WHERE word IN (SELECT word FROM pg_stopwords WHERE cfgname = 'english');\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Custom stop words for specific domains\n",
    "CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY english_custom_stops (\n",
    "    TEMPLATE = simple,\n",
    "    STOPWORDS = english,\n",
    "    ACCEPT = false\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Test stemming variations\n",
    "SELECT lexeme \n",
    "FROM ts_lexize('english_stem', 'running runs ran runner');\n",
    "-- Returns: 'run' for all (aggressive stemming)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Snowball vs. Porter Stemming**:\n",
    "PostgreSQL defaults to Snowball (multilingual). For English-specific Porter stemming (less aggressive):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION public.english_porter (\n",
    "    COPY = pg_catalog.english\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION public.english_porter\n",
    "    ALTER MAPPING FOR asciiword WITH english_porter_stem;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 42.2.3 Custom Configurations for Domain-Specific Search\n",
    "\n",
    "For specialized vocabularies (medical, legal, technical), create custom dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create synonym dictionary\n",
    "CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY tech_synonyms (\n",
    "    TEMPLATE = synonym,\n",
    "    SYNONYMS = tech_terms\n",

    "SELECT to_tsvector('tech_english', 'I love js and postgres');\n",
    "-- Returns: 'javascript':3 'love':2 'postgresql':5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 42.3 Indexing Strategies (GIN vs. GiST)\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient FTS requires specialized indexes. PostgreSQL offers two access methods with distinct trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 42.3.1 GIN Indexes (Preferred for Static Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalized Inverted Index (GIN) is optimized for containment queries and scales well for read-heavy workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Standard GIN index for FTS\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_articles_search ON articles \n",
    "USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || content));\n",
    "\n",
    "-- For multilingual content (language stored in column)\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_articles_multilingual ON articles \n",
    "USING GIN (to_tsvector(language::regconfig, content));\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Covering index with weights (stored generated column)\n",
    "ALTER TABLE articles ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector \n",
    "GENERATED ALWAYS AS (\n",
    "    setweight(to_tsvector('english', coalesce(title, '')), 'A') ||\n",
    "    setweight(to_tsvector('english', coalesce(summary, '')), 'B') ||\n",
    "    setweight(to_tsvector('english', coalesce(content, '')), 'C')\n",
    ") STORED;\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_articles_weighted ON articles USING GIN (search_vector);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**GIN Characteristics**:\n",
    "- **Fast lookup**: O(log n) lexeme retrieval\n",
    "- **Slow updates**: Index maintenance is expensive (inverted lists are long)\n",
    "- **Bloat sensitive**: Frequent updates cause significant index bloat\n",
    "- **FastScan optimization**: PostgreSQL 14+ features faster scans for common terms\n",
    "\n",
    "### 42.3.2 GiST Indexes (For Dynamic Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalized Search Tree (GiST) supports lossy indexing with signature compression, better for frequently updated documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- GiST index for high-churn tables\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_logs_search ON logs \n",
    "USING GiST (to_tsvector('english', message));\n",
    "\n",

    "USING GiST (to_tsvector('english', message) gist_tsvector_ops(siglen=100));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**GiST Characteristics**:\n",
    "- **Update friendly**: Faster insert/update than GIN\n",
    "- **Lossy results**: May return false positives requiring heap recheck (slower exact queries)\n",
    "- **Distance support**: Supports ordering by distance (`<->` operator) for ranking during index scan\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Matrix**:\n",
    "- **Read-heavy, batch-loaded**: GIN (preferred default)\n",
    "- **Write-heavy, real-time**: GiST or GIN with `fastupdate=off` and aggressive autovacuum\n",
    "- **Huge documents (>10KB)**: GiST (smaller index size)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 42.3.3 Index Maintenance and Fast Update\n",
    "\n",
    "GIN's `fastupdate` storage parameter buffers changes for deferred index merging:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create GIN with fastupdate disabled (for real-time consistency)\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_docs_search ON documents \n",
    "USING GIN (search_vector) \n",
    "WITH (fastupdate = off);\n",

    "\n",
    "### 42.4.1 ts_rank and ts_rank_cd\n",
    "\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Core Concepts**: FTS operates on `tsvector` (normalized document representation) and `tsquery` (search predicates). The process involves parsing, stopword removal, and stemming to produce lexemes with position information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configurations**: Text search configurations define parsers and dictionaries. The default `english` configuration uses Snowball stemming and standard stopwords. Custom configurations accommodate domain synonyms and multilingual requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Indexing**: GIN indexes provide fast lookups for read-heavy workloads but suffer update overhead. GiST indexes handle frequent updates better but return lossy results requiring recheck. Use GIN with `fastupdate=off` for real-time consistency or aggressive autovacuum for batch updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ranking**: `ts_rank()` calculates relevance based on term frequency and proximity. `ts_rank_cd()` (Cover Density) weights adjacent terms higher. Use normalization flags to prevent long documents from dominating results solely due to term frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Highlighting**: `ts_headline()` generates contextual snippets with marked search terms but consumes significant CPU—cache results for high-traffic scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Advanced Patterns**: Implement multilingual search via language-specific columns or the `simple` configuration for code. Combine FTS with `pg_trgm` for fuzzy typo tolerance. Use faceted search with GROUP BY for category navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Operational Management**: Monitor FTS index bloat carefully—GIN indexes on high-churn text columns require frequent REINDEX. Filter by restrictive criteria (date ranges) before applying FTS predicates to minimize scan scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Architecture Decisions**: PostgreSQL FTS excels for moderate scale (<50GB text, <1000 QPS) requiring transactional consistency. Migrate to dedicated search engines when horizontal scaling, ML relevance tuning, or massive faceting is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 43, we will explore Geospatial data handling via PostGIS—covering spatial types (geometry, geography), spatial indexing with R-trees (GiST), coordinate reference systems, and practical patterns for location-based queries within the PostgreSQL ecosystem."
