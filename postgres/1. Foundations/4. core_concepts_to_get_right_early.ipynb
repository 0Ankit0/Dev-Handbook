    "# Chapter 4: Core Concepts You Must Get Right Early\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 The Hierarchy: Cluster, Database, Schema, Object\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL organizes data in a four-level hierarchy that differs significantly from other database systems. Misunderstanding these boundaries leads to security vulnerabilities, backup failures, and operational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.1 The Cluster (Instance)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **cluster** (or instance) is a running PostgreSQL server process (`postmaster`) managing a single data directory (`PGDATA`). It contains multiple databases and listens on a single port.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Constraints:**\n",
    "- One cluster = One `PGDATA` directory = One port\n",
    "- Global objects (roles, tablespaces, replication slots) exist at cluster level\n",
    "- A connection is always to one specific database within the cluster; you cannot query across databases in the same cluster without extensions like `postgres_fdw`\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- View cluster-level information\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    pg_postmaster_start_time() as cluster_started,\n",
    "    inet_server_addr() as server_ip,\n",
    "    inet_server_port() as server_port,\n",
    "    current_setting('data_directory') as data_directory,\n",
    "    current_setting('cluster_name') as cluster_name;  -- Set in postgresql.conf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry Standard:** Run separate clusters for truly isolated environments (production vs. staging) rather than relying on database-level separation within one cluster. This prevents accidental cross-database queries and simplifies backup strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.2 Databases (Catalogs)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **database** is a named collection of schemas, tables, and other objects. Each database is isolated; you cannot join tables between databases without Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database Creation Standards:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create database with explicit encoding and locale (never rely on template1 defaults)\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE appdb\n",
    "    WITH \n",
    "    OWNER = app_admin\n",
    "    ENCODING = 'UTF8'\n",
    "    LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.UTF-8'\n",
    "    LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.UTF-8'\n",
    "    TEMPLATE = template0      -- Clean template, ensures no objects from template1\n",
    "    CONNECTION LIMIT = 200;   -- Prevent connection exhaustion\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Comment databases (auditing)\n",
    "COMMENT ON DATABASE appdb IS 'Production application database - Owned by Platform Team';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Database Properties:**\n",
    "- **Encoding**: Fixed at creation (`UTF8` is industry standard; never use SQL_ASCII)\n",
    "- **Locale** (`LC_COLLATE`): Determines string sort order; affects index usage for `ORDER BY` and `LIKE` ranges\n",
    "- **Tablespace**: Default storage location for this database's objects\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Check database encoding and locale (critical for text comparisons)\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    datname,\n",
    "    pg_encoding_to_char(datencoding) as encoding,\n",
    "    datcollate as collation,\n",
    "    datctype as character_classification\n",
    "FROM pg_database \n",
    "WHERE datname = current_database();\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Database size monitoring\n",

    "    datname,\n",
    "    pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(datname)) as size,\n",

    "    datconnlimit as connection_limit\n",
    "FROM pg_database\n",
    "ORDER BY pg_database_size(datname) DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.3 Schemas (Namespaces)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **schema** is a namespace within a database that contains tables, views, functions, and other objects. Schemas prevent naming collisions and enable multi-tenancy patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `public` Schema Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, PostgreSQL places objects in the `public` schema. This is dangerous because:\n",
    "- All users have `CREATE` privileges on `public` by default (until PostgreSQL 15)\n",
    "- It encourages dumping objects into a flat namespace\n",
    "- It complicates migrations and access control\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry Standard Schema Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- 1. Revoke public create privileges (security baseline)\n",
    "REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;\n",
    "REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- 2. Create application-specific schema\n",
    "CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS app;\n",
    "COMMENT ON SCHEMA app IS 'Application tables and business logic';\n",
    "\n",
    "-- 3. Create isolated schemas for extensions\n",
    "CREATE SCHEMA extensions;\n",

    "\n",
    "-- 4. Migration/schema management schema\n",
    "CREATE SCHEMA ddl_history;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- 5. Set search path (schema resolution order)\n",
    "-- NEVER include 'public' first; explicitly order schemas\n",
    "ALTER DATABASE appdb SET search_path TO app, extensions, public;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Verify\n",
    "SHOW search_path;\n",
    "-- Output: app, extensions, public\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search Path Resolution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- PostgreSQL resolves unqualified names using search_path\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users;  -- Finds first 'users' table in search_path order\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Explicit schema qualification (production code standard)\n",

    "-- Current schemas in search path\n",
    "SELECT current_schemas(true);  -- Includes implicit schemas\n",
    "SELECT current_schemas(false); -- User-defined only\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.4 Objects (Tables, Indexes, Views, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final level contains the actual data structures. Object names must be unique within their schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fully Qualified Names:**\n",

    "### 4.3.1 The Page (Block) Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL stores table data in **pages** (also called blocks) of 8KB by default (compile-time constant, rarely changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Page Layout:**\n",
    "- **Header** (24 bytes): Page metadata (checksum, free space pointers)\n",
    "- **Line Pointers** (4 bytes each): Offsets to actual tuples\n",
    "- **Free Space**: Available for new tuples or enlarged existing tuples\n",
    "- **Tuples** (Heap Tuples): The actual row data with headers\n",
    "- **Special Space**: Index-specific data (for index pages)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications:**\n",
    "- Row data cannot exceed ~8KB (minus overhead) without TOAST\n",

    "Collation determines string sort order and comparison behavior. It is set at database creation and inherited by columns, but can be overridden per column or query.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Database default collation\n",
    "SELECT datcollate FROM pg_database WHERE datname = current_database();\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Column-specific collation (for case-insensitive sorting)\n",

    "    code VARCHAR(50) COLLATE \"C\",           -- Binary/ASCII sort (fast, strict)\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(255) COLLATE \"en_US.utf8\"  -- Locale-aware sort (correct for display)\n",

    "-- Query-level collation override\n",
    "SELECT * FROM names ORDER BY last_name COLLATE \"C\";\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Four-Level Hierarchy**: Cluster (instance) \u2192 Database (isolated catalog) \u2192 Schema (namespace) \u2192 Object (table/index). Connections are to one database; cross-database queries require Foreign Data Wrappers.\n",
    "2. **Schema Strategy**: Never use `public` schema for application objects; create dedicated schemas (`app`, `extensions`) and explicitly set `search_path` to prevent squatting and enable logical separation.\n",
    "3. **System Catalogs**: `pg_catalog` for PostgreSQL-specific, performance-critical metadata (OIDs, tablespaces, vacuum stats); `information_schema` for portable, standards-compliant tooling.\n",
    "4. **Physical Storage**: 8KB pages (blocks) store tuples; TOAST handles values >2KB via external storage with compression strategies (`EXTENDED`, `EXTERNAL`, `MAIN`); Visibility Maps enable index-only scans.\n",
    "5. **Naming Standards**: snake_case, singular table names, avoid reserved words, explicit constraint names (`{table}_{column}_{type}`), standard timestamp suffixes (`_at`, `_by`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 5, we will examine PostgreSQL's data type system in depth\u2014covering numeric precision pitfalls, text encoding and collation, timestamp handling with time zones, JSONB versus relational modeling, and array/range types\u2014ensuring you choose the correct type for data integrity and performance."
