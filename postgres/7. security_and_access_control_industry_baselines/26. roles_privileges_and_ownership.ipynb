    "# Chapter 26: Roles, Privileges, and Ownership\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL's security model centers on roles\u2014a unified concept encompassing users and groups\u2014combined with a granular privilege system controlling access to database objects. Proper role architecture is foundational to security, separating application connections, administrative tasks, and read-only analytics while enforcing least privilege principles. This chapter establishes patterns for role design, privilege management, and object ownership hygiene in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 26.1 Role Architecture Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles are global cluster objects (visible across all databases) that own database objects and hold privileges. Understanding the distinction between login roles, group roles, and object ownership is essential for secure design.\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role Hierarchy**: PostgreSQL unifies users and groups into roles with attributes (`LOGIN`, `SUPERUSER`, `CREATEDB`, `CREATEROLE`). Group roles (without `LOGIN`) aggregate privileges assigned to member roles via `GRANT group_role TO login_role`. Role inheritance (`INHERIT` attribute) determines whether member roles automatically possess group privileges or must explicitly `SET ROLE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Privilege Granularity**: Access control operates at multiple levels\u2014database (`CONNECT`), schema (`USAGE`, `CREATE`), table (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, `REFERENCES`, `TRIGGER`), column (`SELECT`/`UPDATE` specific columns), and sequence (`USAGE`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`). Default privileges (`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`) automatically apply to objects created in the future, ensuring consistent access control without manual grants.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Object Ownership**: The role that creates an object owns it, gaining implicit full privileges and bypassing Row-Level Security. Ownership transfer (`ALTER ... OWNER TO`) requires membership in both old and new owner roles (or superuser). Application roles should never own tables (use dedicated owner roles for DDL, separate read/write roles for DML).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Schema Hygiene**: Isolate extensions in dedicated schemas (`extensions`) with restricted `USAGE` grants. Remove `CREATE` privileges from `public` schema to prevent unauthorized object creation. Application data resides in dedicated schemas (`app_data`) with explicit grants, preventing privilege escalation through search_path manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Least Privilege Implementation**: Systematically revoke default permissions (`REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC`) and explicitly grant only necessary access. Use group roles (`app_read`, `app_write`, `app_admin`) to aggregate permissions, assigning login roles to appropriate groups. Regularly audit effective permissions via `information_schema.table_privileges` and `pg_roles` to detect privilege creep.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extension Security**: Trusted extensions operate within database security boundaries; untrusted extensions (requiring `shared_preload_libraries` or C libraries) demand superuser installation and careful access control. Never install untrusted extensions in production without security review. Wrap untrusted functionality in `SECURITY DEFINER` functions with safe `search_path` settings when application access is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 27, we will explore Authentication, pg_hba.conf, and TLS\u2014covering authentication methods, host-based access control configuration, certificate management, and secure connection string patterns for production deployments."
