    "Securing database connections is foundational to production PostgreSQL deployments. This chapter covers the complete authentication stack—from password mechanisms and host-based access rules to TLS encryption and secret management. We emphasize modern, industry-standard practices that satisfy compliance requirements (SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA) while maintaining operational usability.\n",

    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL employs a two-layer authentication model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transport Layer**: TCP connection establishment with optional TLS encryption\n",
    "2. **Application Layer**: Credential validation via configured authentication methods\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Client Request → pg_hba.conf Match → TLS Handshake (if required) → Auth Method → Database Access\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Principle**: Authentication is controlled by the `pg_hba.conf` (Host-Based Authentication configuration) file, which defines *who* can connect *from where* using *which method* to access *which database*.\n",

    "## 27.3 Authentication Methods Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27.3.1 SCRAM-SHA-256 (Production Standard)\n",
    "\n",
    "The default and recommended method for password-based authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "```conf\n",
    "# pg_hba.conf entry\n",
    "host    all             all             10.0.0.0/8              scram-sha-256\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Password never transmitted over the wire (challenge-response protocol)\n",
    "- Resistant to replay attacks\n",
    "- Requires PostgreSQL 10+ (client and server)\n",
    "- Compatible with JDBC, libpq, and modern drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27.3.2 Peer Authentication (Local Connections)\n",
    "\n",
    "For local Unix domain socket connections where the OS user identity is trusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "```conf\n",
    "# pg_hba.conf\n",
    "local   all             postgres                                peer\n",
    "local   all             +dba_users                              peer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**:\n",
    "- PostgreSQL checks the OS user name via `getpeereid()` system call\n",
    "- Database user name must match OS user name (or be mapped via `pg_ident.conf`)\n",
    "- No password required (relies on OS security)\n",
    "- Only works for local socket connections (not TCP/IP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Administrative tasks run by `postgres` OS user\n",
    "- Development environments\n",
    "- CI/CD pipelines where the runner OS user matches the DB user\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27.3.3 Certificate-Based Authentication (SSL)\n",
    "\n",
    "The strongest authentication method for production environments—uses X.509 client certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "```conf\n",
    "# pg_hba.conf\n",
    "hostssl all             all             0.0.0.0/0               cert\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Certificate Requirements**:\n",
    "1. **Client Certificate**: Signed by a trusted CA (can be internal CA)\n",
    "2. **Server Certificate**: Valid for the hostname, not expired\n",
    "3. **Common Name (CN)**: Must match database username (or use mapping)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Generate client certificate (simplified example)\n",
    "# In production, use your organization's PKI or HashiCorp Vault, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Create private key\n",
    "openssl genrsa -out client.key 4096\n",
    "chmod 600 client.key\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Create certificate signing request (CSR)\n",
    "openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr \\\n",
    "    -subj \"/CN=app_user/O=MyOrg/C=US\"\n",

    "# 4. Verify chain\n",
    "openssl verify -CAfile ca.crt client.crt\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Connection with Certificates**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "psql \"postgresql://app_user@db.example.com:5432/mydb?\\\n",

    "sslrootcert=/secure/path/ca.crt\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Notes**:\n",
    "- Private keys (`client.key`) must have permissions `0600` or `0400`\n",
    "- PostgreSQL will reject connections if the key is world-readable\n",
    "- Certificate authentication eliminates password management and rotation complexity\n",
    "- Supports certificate revocation lists (CRLs) for compromised certificates\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Considerations**:\n",
    "- Always use LDAPS (LDAP over SSL) on port 636, never plain LDAP (port 389)\n",
    "- Use `ldaptls=1` to enforce TLS\n",
    "- Consider LDAP + Kerberos (GSSAPI) for stronger security\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SCRAM-SHA-256**: The industry-standard password authentication method that prevents replay attacks and eliminates cleartext password transmission. MD5 is cryptographically broken and must not be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **pg_hba.conf**: The gatekeeper of PostgreSQL access. Rules are processed top-down with the first match winning. Structure entries from most specific to most general, ending with explicit `reject` rules. Use `hostssl` to mandate encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Authentication Methods**: \n",
    "   - `scram-sha-256` for password-based production environments\n",
    "   - `peer` for local administrative access via Unix sockets\n",
    "   - `cert` for high-security environments eliminating password management\n",
    "   - `ldap` with TLS for enterprise integration\n",
    "   - Never use `trust`, `password`, or `md5` in production\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TLS Configuration**: Require TLS 1.2+, use `verify-full` sslmode for hostname verification, ensure server certificates include SAN entries, and protect private keys with strict file permissions (0600).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Secret Management**: Never hardcode passwords. Use environment variables loaded from secure sources, `.pgpass` files with 0600 permissions for scripts, and centralized secrets managers for applications. Implement certificate-based authentication for service-to-service communication to eliminate password rotation complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Operational Security**: Monitor `pg_stat_ssl` for connection encryption status, enable `log_connections` for audit trails, implement certificate revocation lists for compromised credentials, and reload (not restart) `pg_hba.conf` after changes using `pg_reload_conf()` or `kill -HUP`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**: In Chapter 28, we will explore Application Security Patterns, covering Row-Level Security (RLS) implementation, multi-tenant security models, SQL injection prevention strategies, and data masking techniques for compliance with privacy regulations."
