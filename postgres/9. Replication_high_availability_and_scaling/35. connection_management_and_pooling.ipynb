    "PostgreSQL's process-per-connection architecture creates a fundamental tension: applications want many connections for concurrency, but database resources degrade with excessive process counts. This chapter explores the physics of PostgreSQL connections, the necessity of pooling, and production-hardened configurations that prevent the \"too many clients\" outages that plague growing systems.\n",

    "```\n",

    "- Simplest mental model\n",
    "- Supports prepared statements, temporary tables, SET commands, LISTEN/NOTIFY\n",
    "- Poor resource utilization if clients hold connections while idle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Applications using prepared statements extensively, or when `SET` session variables required.\n",

    "**Drawback**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Flask/Django keeping connection open during HTTP request\n",

    "# With 1000 concurrent HTTP requests, need 1000 DB connections\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35.3.3 Pool Mode: Transaction (Production Standard)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavior**: Connection assigned only for duration of transaction; returned to pool on COMMIT/ROLLBACK.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "BEGIN \u2192 Server Connection assigned \u2192 Query \u2192 COMMIT \u2192 Server Connection released\n",
    "Next query \u2192 Different server connection may be used\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Maximum efficiency: 100 DB connections can serve 10,000 application connections\n",
    "- Prepared statements not supported across transactions (must be re-prepared)\n",
    "- Temporary tables cleared after each transaction\n",
    "- `SET` commands don't persist across queries\n",

    "**Application Adaptation Required**:\n",

    "# Bad: Assumes prepared statement persists\n",
    "cur.execute(\"PREPARE get_user AS SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1\")\n",
    "cur.execute(\"EXECUTE get_user(123)\")  # Works in session mode\n",

    "\n",
    "### 35.3.4 Pool Mode: Statement (Rarely Used)\n",

    "\n",
    "Since prepared statements are session-bound and transaction mode rotates connections:\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connection Architecture**: PostgreSQL's process-per-connection model consumes ~5-10 MB RAM per backend plus `work_mem` allocations. The practical limit is 500-1000 connections; beyond this requires pooling to prevent memory exhaustion and context-switching overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pooling Modes**: \n",
    "   - **Session mode** maintains connection state (prepared statements, temp tables) but offers poor concurrency.\n",
    "   - **Transaction mode** (industry standard) assigns connections only for transaction duration, allowing 10,000+ application connections to share 100 database connections. Requires `DISCARD ALL` for cleanup and breaks prepared statements across transactions.\n",
    "   - **Statement mode** rotates per query\u2014rarely used except for sharding proxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PgBouncer Configuration**: Deploy between applications and database with `pool_mode = transaction`. Set `max_client_conn` high (10,000+) to accommodate all application instances, `default_pool_size` modest (20-50) based on database capacity, and `reserve_pool_size` for burst handling. Use `server_lifetime` to recycle connections and prevent memory fragmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Safety Timeouts**: Coordinate `statement_timeout` in PostgreSQL with `query_timeout` in PgBouncer. Set `server_connect_timeout` low for fast failure detection. Use `client_idle_timeout` to reap dead application connections but ensure it exceeds application-side pool idle timeout.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Operational Patterns**: Use separate database aliases in PgBouncer (`production`, `production_reporting`) to isolate pool resources between OLTP and analytical workloads. Monitor `cl_waiting` in `SHOW POOLS`\u2014any value above zero indicates pool exhaustion requiring size increases or query optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**: In Chapter 36, we will cover Scaling Strategies\u2014exploring vertical scaling limits, read replica scaling with load balancing, connection pooling at scale, sharding fundamentals and tradeoffs, and caching layer integration with consistency considerations."
