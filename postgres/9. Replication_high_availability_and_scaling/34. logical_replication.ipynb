    "# Chapter 34: Logical Replication\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical replication provides fine-grained, selective data replication at the row level, enabling zero-downtime migrations, data warehousing pipelines, and cross-database data distribution. Unlike physical replication which replicates byte-for-byte disk blocks, logical replication decodes WAL into SQL operations, allowing replication between different PostgreSQL versions, architectures, and selectively filtered datasets.\n",

    "| **Cross-Version** | No (same major version) | Yes (PG10+ to PG16+) |\n",
    "| **Cross-Architecture** | No (same endian/OS) | Yes (x86 to ARM, Linux to Windows) |\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Architecture**: Logical replication decodes WAL into row changes using the `pgoutput` plugin, enabling cross-version and selective replication. It requires `wal_level = logical` and uses publications (what to send) and subscriptions (what to receive).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Publications**: Define replicated data with `CREATE PUBLICATION`. Use row filters (`WHERE` clauses, PG15+) for partial replication and column lists to exclude sensitive data. Publications do not include schema changes (DDL)—schema must be managed manually on subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subscriptions**: Create with `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION`, specifying connection strings and `copy_data = true` for initial sync. Monitor `pg_subscription_rel` for table-level synchronization state. Use `streaming = true` (PG14+) for in-progress transaction streaming to reduce lag.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conflict Handling**: By default, replication stops on conflicts (duplicate keys, missing rows). PostgreSQL 15+ offers `conflict_resolution` options (`apply_remote`, `keep_local`), but best practice is to avoid conflicts through directional replication (write to publisher only) or application-level partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Limitations**: Sequences are not replicated (use UUIDs or manually sync). TRUNCATE replicates but may conflict with foreign keys. DDL changes halt replication until schemas are manually aligned. Large objects and toasted data have edge cases requiring careful handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Operational Patterns**: Use logical replication for major version upgrades (PG15→PG16), data warehousing (selective column/row filtering), and microservices data distribution. Always monitor replication slot lag to prevent disk space exhaustion on the publisher, and set `max_slot_wal_keep_size` to limit retention risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**: In Chapter 35, we will explore Connection Management and Pooling—covering why connection count matters, PgBouncer configuration and modes (session/transaction/statement), prepared statement handling, and integration patterns with modern application architectures."
