    "# Chapter 25: Extensions and Ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL's extensibility allows adding functionality through shared libraries without modifying core code. While extensions provide powerful capabilities—ranging from cryptographic functions to geospatial indexing—they introduce operational complexity regarding security, replication, and version compatibility. This chapter establishes safe patterns for extension adoption, management, and lifecycle maintenance in production environments.\n",

    "## 25.1 Extension Architecture and Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions package SQL objects (functions, types, indexes, tables) together, managed through a centralized catalog system that tracks dependencies and versions.\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extension Management**: Extensions package SQL objects into versioned bundles managed via `CREATE EXTENSION`, `ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`, and `DROP EXTENSION`. Install extensions into dedicated schemas (e.g., `extensions`) to avoid namespace pollution and manage search paths explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Security Classifications**: Trusted extensions (e.g., `pgcrypto`, `citext`) operate within database security boundaries and can be installed by non-superusers. Untrusted extensions (e.g., `plpython3u`, `file_fdw`) execute with OS-level privileges, require superuser installation, and must be wrapped with `SECURITY DEFINER` functions for application access.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Essential Toolkit**: `pgcrypto` provides cryptographic hashing and encryption (CPU-intensive, secure key management required); `uuid-ossp` generates various UUID formats (prefer v1 for time-ordering, v4 for randomness); `citext` enables transparent case-insensitive comparisons without functional indexes; `pg_trgm` powers fuzzy text matching and leading-wildcard LIKE queries; `pg_stat_statements` requires `shared_preload_libraries` configuration and tracks query performance statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Versioning Strategy**: Extension updates execute SQL migration scripts (`--old--new.sql`) during `ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`. Breaking changes may require dump/restore (e.g., PostGIS major versions). Test updates in transactions that can roll back; downgrades typically require extension removal and reinstallation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Operational Impact**: Extensions affect logical replication (must be installed on subscribers), physical replication (inherited automatically), and cloud provider compatibility (check allowlists). Some require `shared_preload_libraries` modifications necessitating restarts. Monitor memory usage for statistics-collecting extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Governance**: Maintain tiered approval lists (Standard/Restricted/Prohibited) with criteria for maintenance status, security auditing, and licensing compliance. Scan for unused extensions periodically and remove them to reduce attack surface and maintenance burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 26, we will begin Part VII (Security and Access Control) with an exploration of Roles, Privileges, and Ownership—covering role design patterns, least privilege principles, object ownership management, and default privilege configurations for secure multi-tenant environments."
