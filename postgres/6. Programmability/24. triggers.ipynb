    "Triggers automate actions in response to data changes, ensuring integrity constraints and audit trails execute reliably. However, they introduce hidden execution paths that complicate debugging and can severely impact performance. This chapter establishes when triggers are appropriate, implementation patterns for auditing and cache maintenance, and strict guidelines for avoiding operational nightmares.\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trigger Types**: BEFORE triggers modify data or validate before persistence; AFTER triggers handle cascading logic and auditing (NEW is read-only); INSTEAD OF enables updatable views. Row-level triggers execute per row; statement-level triggers execute once per operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Auditing**: Use JSONB columns to store flexible row snapshots in audit tables. Prefer selective auditing (specific columns or status changes) over full-row logging to reduce write overhead. Use `txid_current()` to correlate audit entries with transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cache Maintenance**: Counter caches and denormalized aggregates in triggers provide fast reads at the cost of doubled write latency and tight coupling. Consider materialized views or application-level cache invalidation queues for less critical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validation**: Triggers enforce cross-table constraints and temporal logic that FOREIGN KEY and CHECK constraints cannot express. Use `FOR SHARE` row locking in validation triggers to prevent race conditions between check and commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hidden Complexity**: Triggers create \"spooky action at a distance\" where simple UPDATE statements cascade into multiple table modifications, complicating debugging and performance analysis. Document all trigger chains and avoid circular dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Testing**: Test triggers within transactions that roll back to isolate side effects. Use `RAISE NOTICE` or logging triggers to verify execution order. Monitor `pg_stat_user_functions` to identify slow triggers blocking high-volume operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 25, we will explore Extensions and Ecosystem\u2014covering extension management, trusted vs untrusted extensions, versioning strategies, and the operational implications of incorporating external code into your database."
