    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conditional Logic**: Use `CASE` for conditional expressions (searched CASE for complex logic, simple CASE for equality); prefer `FILTER` clause over `CASE` in aggregates for readability; `COALESCE` for first non-NULL value (left-to-right evaluation); `NULLIF` to convert specific values to NULL (essential for safe division and data cleaning).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **String Manipulation**: Concatenate with `||` (ANSI standard) or `CONCAT` (NULL-safe); use `FORMAT` for type-safe templating; leverage `REGEXP_REPLACE` and `REGEXP_MATCHES` for pattern extraction; `STRING_AGG` for row-to-string aggregation with ordering; understand `OCTET_LENGTH` vs `CHAR_LENGTH` for UTF-8 data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Date/Time Operations**: Store all timestamps as `TIMESTAMPTZ` (UTC); use `NOW()` (transaction time) for consistency, `CLOCK_TIMESTAMP()` for wall-clock timing; `DATE_TRUNC` for period grouping; `AGE` for human-readable intervals; `GENERATE_SERIES` for time sequences; handle timezones with `AT TIME ZONE` conversions in application layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **JSON/JSONB**: Prefer `JSONB` for storage (binary, indexed, normalized); use `->>` for text extraction, `->` for JSON extraction; `@>` for containment queries (indexable); `||` for merging objects; `JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT` for construction; `JSONB_AGG` for aggregation; use SQL/JSON path (`JSONB_PATH_QUERY`) for complex navigation (PostgreSQL 12+).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Common Table Expressions**: Use non-recursive CTEs for query organization and optimization fencing (MATERIALIZED prevents inlining); use recursive CTEs for hierarchical data with cycle detection (`ARRAY` tracking); remember CTEs act as optimization fences (execute once, materialize result).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **LATERAL Joins**: Enable correlated subqueries in FROM clause; essential for \"Top N per group\" patterns when combined with `LIMIT`; allows set-returning functions to reference outer tables; ensure proper indexes exist on lateral subquery join columns for performance; consider window functions as alternatives for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 10, we will explore schema design fundamentals for OLTP systems—covering normalization strategies, key selection, handling many-to-many relationships, and implementing soft deletes and audit patterns that scale."
