    "# Chapter 5: Data Types Done Right\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing incorrect data types is one of the most expensive mistakes in database design. Type changes require table rewrites, index rebuilds, and application refactoring. This chapter establishes the decision criteria for PostgreSQL's type system, emphasizing correctness, storage efficiency, and operational safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1 Numeric Types: Precision, Money, and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL offers multiple numeric categories: integers, arbitrary precision, floating-point, and the notorious `MONEY` type. Each has specific semantics that affect calculation accuracy and storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.1 Integer Types: When Size Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL provides five integer types. The industry standard is to use the smallest type that accommodates your data range, with a bias toward `BIGINT` for primary keys to prevent overflow in high-volume systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Integer type selection guide\n",
    "-- SMALLINT (-32768 to 32767): 2 bytes\n",
    "-- INTEGER (-2147483648 to 2147483647): 4 bytes  \n",
    "-- BIGINT (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807): 8 bytes\n",

    "\n",
    "`NUMERIC` and `DECIMAL` are synonymous in PostgreSQL. They store exact precision up to 16383 digits before the decimal point and 16383 after, using variable storage (2-4 bytes overhead plus 2 bytes per 4 decimal digits).\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Exact Precision:**\n",
    "- Financial calculations where rounding errors are unacceptable\n",
    "- Scientific measurements requiring exact decimal representation\n",
    "- Compliance requirements (GAAP, SOX) mandating precise arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Financial amounts: store as integer cents or exact decimal\n",
    "CREATE TABLE transactions (\n",
    "    -- Option 1: Integer cents (industry standard for high performance)\n",

    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Why not (19,2)? Tax calculations (e.g., 8.875%) require 4 decimal places\n",
    "-- Why not FLOAT? 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3 in floating point\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Warning:** `NUMERIC` operations are 5-10x slower than integer math. For high-frequency trading or real-time analytics, consider storing as `BIGINT` (cents) and formatting at the application layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.3 Floating-Point: `REAL` and `DOUBLE PRECISION`\n",
    "\n",
    "IEEE 754 floating-point types sacrifice exactness for performance and range. Never use them for money or equality comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Legitimate uses: scientific measurements, lat/long coordinates, ML features\n",
    "CREATE TABLE sensor_readings (\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.4 The `MONEY` Type: A Cautionary Tale\n",
    "\n",
    "**Never use the `MONEY` type.** It is a legacy type with dangerous semantics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stores data as numeric, but displays with locale-specific formatting\n",
    "- Fixed fractional precision (2 decimals) unsuitable for high-precision finance\n",
    "- Portability issues (behavior changes with `lc_monetary` setting)\n",
    "- Limited operator support (cannot multiply MONEY by MONEY)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Instead of:\n",
    "price MONEY,\n",

    "## 5.2 Text Types: Encoding, Collation, and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL's text handling is powerful but requires understanding of character sets, collation (sorting rules), and the `VARCHAR(n)` vs `TEXT` distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2.1 `TEXT` vs `VARCHAR(n)`: The Definitive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "In PostgreSQL, `TEXT` and `VARCHAR` (without length) are identical in storage and performance. `VARCHAR(n)` adds a length constraint check.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry Standard:**\n",
    "- Use `TEXT` for virtually all character data\n",
    "- Add `CHECK` constraints for length limits ( clearer error messages, easier to change)\n",
    "- Reserve `VARCHAR(n)` only for strict interoperability requirements (e.g., fixed-width mainframe integration)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Preferred approach: TEXT with constraints\n",
    "CREATE TABLE articles (\n",
    "    article_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    title TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (LENGTH(title) BETWEEN 10 AND 200),\n",
    "    -- Clear error: \"violates check constraint articles_title_check\"\n",
    "    -- vs \"value too long for type character varying(200)\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    slug TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (slug ~ '^[a-z0-9-]+$'),\n",
    "    -- Regex validation more useful than length limit\n",
    "    \n",
    "    content TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (octet_length(content) < 1000000),\n",
    "    -- Byte length check for storage limits (1MB max)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    summary TEXT CHECK (summary IS NULL OR LENGTH(summary) <= 500)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Legacy/Interop approach (when required)\n",
    "CREATE TABLE legacy_integration (\n",
    "    account_code VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,  -- Fixed width from mainframe\n",
    "    description VARCHAR(255)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Storage Details:**\n",
    "- Both use variable-length storage with 1-4 byte length prefix\n",
    "- No padding (unlike `CHAR(n)` which pads with spaces)\n",
    "- TOAST kicks in at ~2KB, compressing large text automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2.2 Character Encoding: UTF-8 Enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL databases are created with a specific encoding. Industry standard is **UTF-8** exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Verify database encoding\n",
    "SELECT pg_encoding_to_char(encoding) \n",
    "FROM pg_database \n",
    "WHERE datname = current_database();\n",
    "-- Must return 'UTF8'\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Client encoding (should match database)\n",
    "SHOW client_encoding;\n",
    "SET client_encoding TO 'UTF8';\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Detect encoding violations (migration from legacy systems)\n",
    "SELECT column_name \n",
    "FROM table_name \n",
    "WHERE column_name <> convert_from(convert_to(column_name, 'UTF8'), 'UTF8');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Warning:** If `client_encoding` differs from server encoding, PostgreSQL automatically transcodes data. This can cause errors (invalid byte sequences) or silent data corruption if the client claims wrong encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2.3 Collation (LC_COLLATE): Sorting and Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Collation determines string sort order, equality, and range comparisons. It is set at database creation but can be overridden per column or query.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Database default (from template)\n",
    "SELECT datcollate FROM pg_database WHERE datname = current_database();\n",
    "-- Typically 'en_US.utf8' or 'C'\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Column-specific collation for case-insensitive storage\n",
    "CREATE TABLE user_emails (\n",
    "    email_address TEXT PRIMARY KEY COLLATE \"C\",  \n",
    "    -- Binary collation: fast, strict, case-sensitive, dot-sensitive\n",
    "    -- Required for email uniqueness (John@example.com ≠ john@example.com per RFC)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    display_name TEXT COLLATE \"en_US\"\n",
    "    -- Locale-aware for proper sorting (Ü sorts with U in German, after Z in Swedish)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Query-level override\n",
    "SELECT * FROM products \n",
    "ORDER BY name COLLATE \"C\";  -- Fast binary sort\n",
    "-- vs\n",
    "ORDER BY name COLLATE \"en_US\";  -- Locale-aware (slower)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Impact:**\n",
    "- `C` or `POSIX` collation uses byte-wise comparison (fast, index-friendly)\n",
    "- Locale collations (`en_US`, `de_DE`) use complex linguistic rules (slower, but correct for display)\n",
    "- Indexes inherit collation; mixing collations in queries prevents index usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case-Insensitive Searching Standard:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Option 1: citext extension (case-insensitive text type)\n",
    "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;\n",
    "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "    email CITEXT PRIMARY KEY  -- 'John@Example.com' matches 'john@example.com'\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Option 2: Functional index with LOWER() (more control)\n",
    "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX users_email_lower_ukey ON users (LOWER(email_address));\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE LOWER(email_address) = LOWER('John@Example.com');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.3 Temporal Types: Time Zones, Precision, and Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Time handling is the source of more production bugs than any other data type category. PostgreSQL offers rich temporal support, but requires explicit timezone discipline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3.1 `TIMESTAMPTZ` vs `TIMESTAMP`: The Critical Distinction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` (`TIMESTAMPTZ`)**: Stores moment in time as UTC internally, displays in session timezone. **Always use this.**\n",
    "- **`TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE` (`TIMESTAMP`)**: Stores calendar/wall-clock time without zone context. Use only for future local events (meetings) or abstract times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Industry standard: Always use TIMESTAMPTZ for events\n",

    "-- Always displays as '2024-01-15 12:00:00' regardless of session zone\n",
    "-- Is this noon UTC? Noon local? Impossible to tell without metadata.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "1. **Database server**: Set `timezone = 'UTC'` in `postgresql.conf`\n",
    "2. **Application connections**: Always use UTC (`SET TIME ZONE 'UTC'`)\n",
    "3. **Display conversion**: Convert to local time in application layer (JavaScript, Python, etc.)\n",
    "4. **Never store**: Local times with offset stripped (e.g., stripping '-05:00' from '12:00-05:00')\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interval Storage Optimization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- INTERVAL uses 16 bytes. For simple day counts, use INTEGER:\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Numeric Types**: Use `BIGINT` for IDs (or `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`), `NUMERIC` for exact financial math (or `BIGINT` cents for performance), avoid `FLOAT` for money, never use `MONEY` type.\n",
    "2. **Text Types**: Use `TEXT` with `CHECK` constraints instead of `VARCHAR(n)`, enforce UTF-8 encoding, choose collation (`C` for identifiers, locale-specific for display names) carefully.\n",
    "3. **Temporal Types**: Always use `TIMESTAMPTZ` (UTC storage) for timestamps, use `DATE` for birthdays, use `TSTZRANGE` for scheduling with exclusion constraints.\n",
    "4. **UUID**: Use `gen_random_uuid()` for distributed/external IDs, prefer `BIGINT` for internal joins, consider UUIDv7 for time-sortable uniqueness.\n",
    "5. **JSONB**: Prefer over `JSON` for binary efficiency and indexing, use GIN indexes for containment queries, use expression indexes for specific path queries, avoid storing foreign references in JSONB.\n",
    "6. **Arrays**: Useful for tags and simple collections with GIN indexing, but violate normalization—avoid for foreign key references or large collections.\n",
    "7. **Enums**: Space-efficient for static value sets, but prefer lookup tables for business values requiring metadata or frequent changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 6, we will explore table creation and constraints in depth—covering primary key strategies, foreign key enforcement with proper ON DELETE behaviors, CHECK constraints for data quality, exclusion constraints for complex uniqueness, and generated columns for derived data."
