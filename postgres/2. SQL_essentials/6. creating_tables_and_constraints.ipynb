    "# Chapter 6: Creating Tables and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Table creation is the foundation of database design. Poor decisions here cascade into application bugs, performance issues, and maintenance nightmares. This chapter establishes industry-standard patterns for table structure, constraint enforcement, and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Primary Key Strategies: The Identity Crisis\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of primary key affects storage, performance, join efficiency, and application architecture. This decision is difficult to reverse without full table rebuilds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.1 Surrogate Keys (System-Generated)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry Standard:** Use surrogate keys (BIGINT identity) for most tables. They never change, are compact for joins, and decouple identity from business meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Modern standard: GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (PostgreSQL 10+)\n",
    "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "    user_id BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY \n",

    "        PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    -- START WITH 1000000: Avoids conflicts with imported legacy data\n",
    "    -- IDs below 1M reserved for special system accounts or data migration\n",
    "    \n",
    "    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Detailed explanation:\n",
    "-- GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY:\n",
    "-- 1. SQL standard compliant (portable to Oracle, SQL Server, DB2)\n",
    "-- 2. Sequence automatically owned by table (dropped with table)\n",
    "-- 3. Cannot accidentally override ID without OVERRIDING clause (safety)\n",
    "-- 4. Cleaner DDL than SERIAL\n",
    "-- 5. Easier to modify (change sequence parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Behind the scenes:\n",
    "-- PostgreSQL creates an implicit sequence: users_user_id_seq\n",
    "-- Default value: nextval('users_user_id_seq')\n",
    "-- But it's cleaner and more standard than SERIAL\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Insert (ID auto-generated)\n",
    "INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('user@example.com');\n",
    "-- Returns: user_id = 1000000\n",

    "INSERT INTO users (user_id, email) VALUES (999, 'admin@example.com');\n",
    "-- ERROR: cannot insert into column \"user_id\"\n",

    "--    (Can be dangerous - accidental duplicates)\n",
    "-- 2. SERIAL sequence is not SQL standard\n",
    "-- 3. SERIAL dumps in pg_dump include sequence state (can cause issues)\n",
    "-- 4. IDENTITY is cleaner and safer\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Key Strategies**: Use `BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` as the industry standard for surrogate keys (portable, safe, auto-cleanup). Use natural keys only for immutable, compact, business-meaningful identifiers (ISO codes, not emails). Consider UUIDs for external-facing IDs or distributed systems, preferably in hybrid mode (internal BIGINT, external UUID).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Foreign Keys**: Always specify `ON DELETE` behavior explicitly (`RESTRICT` for safety, `CASCADE` for truly dependent data, `SET NULL` for historical records). Use `ON UPDATE CASCADE` only with natural keys. **Critical**: Index foreign key columns manually\u2014PostgreSQL does not auto-index them, and missing indexes cause table locks on parent deletes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CHECK Constraints**: Enforce domain rules at the database level (positive prices, valid date ranges, regex patterns). They prevent invalid data regardless of application bugs. Use `NOT VALID` for adding to existing tables without locking, then `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **UNIQUE Constraints**: Single and multi-column uniqueness, partial unique indexes for conditional uniqueness (e.g., one active promotion per product). Remember PostgreSQL allows multiple NULLs in unique columns (SQL standard behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **NOT NULL and DEFAULT**: Use `NOT NULL` for required fields, `DEFAULT` for automatic values (timestamps, UUIDs). Adding `NOT NULL` to existing tables requires care\u2014update existing NULLs first or use `NOT VALID` workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Generated Columns**: Use `GENERATED ALWAYS AS ... STORED` for derived data (price in dollars, search vectors) that must be persisted and indexed. Computed on write/update, stored on disk, cannot be modified directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Exclusion Constraints**: Use GiST-based exclusion constraints for complex uniqueness like non-overlapping time ranges (no double-booking). Requires `btree_gist` extension for scalar types. Supports `WHERE` clauses for partial exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Deferred Constraints**: Use `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED` for circular foreign keys or multi-step operations that temporarily violate constraints. Checked at transaction commit, not immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Constraint Management**: Name constraints explicitly (`{table}_{column}_{type}`) for debugging and migrations. Use `NOT VALID` + `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` workflow for adding constraints to large tables without long locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 7, we will explore CRUD operations and filtering\u2014covering INSERT with RETURNING, UPDATE strategies, DELETE safety patterns, WHERE clause optimization, NULL handling semantics, and pagination techniques that perform at scale."
