    "# Chapter 7: CRUD Operations and Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations is fundamental to PostgreSQL proficiency. This chapter covers industry-standard patterns for data manipulation, emphasizing safety, performance, and correctness at scale.\n",

    "## 7.1 INSERT Operations: Beyond Basic Insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1.1 Single Row Insertion with RETURNING\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RETURNING` clause retrieves values generated during insertion without requiring a second query. This is essential for IDs, timestamps, and computed columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Basic insert (anti-pattern: requires second query to get ID)\n",
    "INSERT INTO users (email, full_name) \n",
    "VALUES ('alice@example.com', 'Alice Johnson');\n",
    "-- Now you have to query: SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE email = 'alice@example.com';\n",
    "-- Race condition risk: another insert might happen between statements\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Industry standard: RETURNING clause\n",
    "INSERT INTO users (email, full_name) \n",

    "RETURNING user_id, created_at, email;\n",
    "-- Returns the generated ID and defaults in one atomic operation\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Detailed explanation:\n",
    "-- RETURNING works with:\n",
    "-- 1. Generated columns (SERIAL, IDENTITY, UUID)\n",
    "-- 2. DEFAULT values (NOW(), triggers)\n",
    "-- 3. Computed columns (generated columns)\n",
    "-- 4. Any inserted column value\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Application usage (pseudo-code):\n",
    "-- user = db.query(\"INSERT INTO users ... RETURNING user_id, created_at\")\n",
    "-- application.user_id = user.user_id  -- Immediately available\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **INSERT Operations**: Use `RETURNING` to retrieve generated values atomically; bulk insert with multi-row VALUES or `COPY` for performance; leverage `ON CONFLICT` for upsert patterns (DO UPDATE for merges, DO NOTHING for idempotency); disable triggers temporarily only for initial data loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **UPDATE Strategies**: Always use `RETURNING` to verify changes; batch large updates using `ctid` with `LIMIT` to prevent long transactions and table bloat; use optimistic locking (`version` column) to prevent lost updates; never update without a `WHERE` clause (use transactions to verify row counts first).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DELETE Safety**: Implement soft deletes (`deleted_at` timestamp) for data recovery; use partial unique indexes (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`) to allow reuse of unique values after soft delete; batch hard deletes to prevent locking; use `TRUNCATE` for complete table wipes (fast but irreversible).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **WHERE Clause Optimization**: Write SARGable predicates (avoid functions on indexed columns, implicit type conversions, leading wildcards); understand three-valued logic (`IS NULL`, not `= NULL`); use `EXISTS` instead of `IN` for subqueries; use `UNION` instead of `OR` for disparate conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **NULL Handling**: SQL uses TRUE/FALSE/UNKNOWN logic; `NULL = NULL` is UNKNOWN (not TRUE); use `IS NULL`/`IS NOT NULL` for comparisons; use `COALESCE` to provide defaults; use `NULLIF` to convert values to NULL; remember aggregates ignore NULLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Pagination**: Avoid `OFFSET` for large result sets (O(n) performance); use keyset pagination (seek method) with `WHERE (col1, col2) > (last_val1, last_val2)` for O(1) performance; use server-side cursors for processing large datasets in batches; consider estimated counts instead of exact `COUNT(*)` for large tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 8, we will explore joins, aggregation, and set logic—covering inner and outer join mechanics, aggregation with GROUP BY and HAVING, window functions for analytical queries, and set operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT) that combine result sets."
