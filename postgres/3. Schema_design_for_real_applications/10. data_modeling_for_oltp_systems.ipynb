    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normalization (1NF-BCNF)**: Enforce 1NF by eliminating repeating groups (use junction tables); ensure 2NF by removing partial dependencies (separate tables for dependent attributes); achieve 3NF by eliminating transitive dependencies (don't store derived data); apply BCNF by ensuring every determinant is a candidate key (decompose multi-value dependencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pragmatic Denormalization**: Store computed aggregates in parent tables using triggers for transactional consistency; use materialized views for complex read-heavy aggregations with scheduled refreshes; always document denormalized fields and maintain them through database constraints, not application logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Selection**: Prefer surrogate keys (BIGSERIAL or UUID) for internal references with unique constraints on natural business keys; use BIGSERIAL for single-node OLTP (better clustering, smaller size); use UUID v7 (time-ordered) or v4 for distributed systems; implement composite keys for pure junction tables, but use surrogate keys for \"rich\" associations with metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Many-to-Many Patterns**: Design association tables to carry relationship metadata (quantity, role, timestamps); create indexes for both directions of the relationship; consider closure tables for hierarchical data requiring fast subtree queries; use adjacency lists with recursive CTEs for simple hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Soft Deletes**: Implement `deleted_at` timestamps with partial unique indexes to allow business key reuse; create views (`active_users`) to hide deleted records from applications; cascade soft deletes through triggers; purge hard deletes only after retention periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Temporal Modeling**: Maintain history tables with `valid_from`/`valid_to` ranges; use exclusion constraints to prevent overlapping periods; implement triggers to automatically archive changes; consider range types (`TSTZRANGE`) for efficient temporal queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Audit Standards**: Include `created_at`, `created_by`, `updated_at`, `updated_by`, and `version` (optimistic locking) on all tables; use generic CDC triggers for compliance-heavy environments storing JSONB snapshots; prefer database-level auditing over application-level to catch all changes including ad-hoc updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 11, we will explore PostgreSQL schemas (namespaces) for multi-tenant architectures and bounded contexts\u2014covering search paths, schema-based access control, and patterns for isolating tenant data while maintaining operational efficiency."
