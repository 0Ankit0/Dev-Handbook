    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL's declarative partitioning, introduced in PostgreSQL 10 and significantly enhanced in subsequent versions, provides a robust mechanism for dividing large tables into smaller, more manageable physical pieces. This chapter covers when to partition, how to implement range, list, and hash strategies, and operational patterns for maintaining high-performance partitioned tables in production environments.\n",

    "\n",
    "-- GOOD candidates for partitioning:\n",
    "-- 1. Time-series data with rolling retention (logs, events, metrics)\n",
    "-- 2. Tables > 100GB with clear access patterns (recent data hot, old data cold)\n",
    "-- 3. Need to efficiently bulk-drop old data (DROP vs DELETE)\n",
    "-- 4. Different storage requirements per data segment (SSD for recent, HDD for archive)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- BAD candidates for partitioning:\n",
    "-- 1. Tables < 10GB (overhead outweighs benefits)\n",
    "-- 2. No clear partition key (random access patterns)\n",
    "-- 3. Heavy cross-partition joins/aggregations without partition-wise support\n",
    "-- 4. Frequent updates that move rows between partitions (partition key updates are expensive)\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Global vs Local indexes\n",
    "-- PostgreSQL only supports local indexes (indexes on partitions)\n",
    "-- There are no \"global\" indexes spanning all partitions (Oracle feature)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Creating indexes on partitioned tables automatically creates on all partitions\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_events_user_id ON events(user_id);\n",
    "-- Creates: idx_events_user_id on events_2024_01, events_2024_02, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Unique indexes must include partition key\n",
    "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_events_unique ON events(event_id, created_at);\n",
    "-- Must include created_at because it's the partition key\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Adding index to existing partitioned table\n",
    "CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_payload ON events USING GIN(payload);\n",
    "-- Runs on all partitions concurrently (PostgreSQL 11+)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Partition-specific indexes (not inherited)\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_events_2024_01_special ON events_2024_01(user_id) \n",
    "WHERE event_type = 'error';  -- Partial index on specific partition only\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.5.2 Attach and Detach Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Detach partition (fast metadata operation, no data movement)\n",
    "ALTER TABLE events DETACH PARTITION events_2023_12;\n",
    "-- Partition becomes standalone table instantly\n",
    "-- Can then archive, drop, or process separately\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Attach existing table as partition (must have compatible structure)\n",
    "CREATE TABLE events_2024_04 (LIKE events INCLUDING ALL);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Load data into standalone table first (faster than inserting through parent)\n",
    "COPY events_2024_04 FROM '/data/april_events.csv' WITH CSV;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Validate constraints before attaching (avoids long locks)\n",
    "ALTER TABLE events_2024_04 ADD CONSTRAINT valid_range \n",
    "    CHECK (created_at >= '2024-04-01' AND created_at < '2024-05-01') NOT VALID;\n",

    "ALTER TABLE events ATTACH PARTITION events_2024_04 \n",

    "-- Brief exclusive lock on parent, but operations continue on other partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Detach with pending data (PostgreSQL 14+)\n",

    "-- PITFALL 1: Too many partitions\n",
    "-- Creating daily partitions for 10 years = 3650 partitions\n",
    "-- Slows down planning time, catalog bloat\n",
    "-- Solution: Use monthly partitions, or sub-partitioning (month then day)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- PITFALL 2: Updating partition key\n",
    "-- This fails if it would move row to different partition\n",
    "UPDATE events SET created_at = created_at + INTERVAL '1 month' WHERE event_id = 123;\n",
    "-- ERROR: row movement between partitions not allowed by default (before PG 11)\n",
    "-- In PG 11+: Enable row movement explicitly\n",
    "ALTER TABLE events ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;\n",
    "-- But: It's slow (DELETE + INSERT), avoid frequent updates to partition keys\n",
    "\n",
    "-- PITFALL 3: Long transactions holding back drop\n",
    "-- If a long-running query is using partition X, you cannot DROP or DETACH it\n",
    "-- Check for locks:\n",
    "SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;\n",
    "-- Wait for or terminate blocking queries before maintenance\n",

    "-- PITFALL 4: Foreign keys TO partitioned tables\n",

    "-- 1. No unique constraints on partitioned tables (excluding PK with partition key)\n",
    "-- 2. FK checks may need to scan all partitions (slow)\n",
    "-- Solution: Reference the parent table, not individual partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "-- PITFALL 5: Cross-partition constraints\n",
    "-- Cannot enforce unique constraints across partitions (except with PK including partition key)\n",
    "-- Solution: Application-level enforcement or careful partition key selection\n",

    "-- PITFALL 6: Statistics and planning\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When to Partition**: Use partitioning for tables >100GB with time-series or categorical access patterns requiring efficient bulk deletion; avoid for small tables (<10GB), random access patterns, or frequent partition key updates. Partitioning trades operational complexity for query performance and maintenance efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partitioning Strategies**: Use **Range partitioning** for time-series data (rolling windows, archival); **List partitioning** for discrete categorical values (tenant tiers, regions); **Hash partitioning** for even distribution when no natural range exists (random UUIDs). Combine strategies via sub-partitioning for large-scale data (range by date, then hash by tenant).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Partition Management**: Implement automated scripts to create future partitions (proactive) and detach/drop old partitions (retention policies); use the `DEFAULT` partition as a safety net but monitor closely; attach pre-populated tables for fast bulk loads without locking parent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance Optimization**: Enable `enable_partition_pruning` to eliminate irrelevant partitions at planning time; use `enable_partitionwise_join` and `enable_partitionwise_aggregate` when joining or aggregating compatibly partitioned tables for significant performance gains; ensure partition keys appear in `WHERE` clauses without functions to enable pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Constraints and Indexing**: All unique constraints (including `PRIMARY KEY`) must include partition key columns; indexes are always local (per-partition), created automatically on parent and inherited by children; use partial indexes on specific partitions for specialized access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Operational Best Practices**: Use `DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY` (PostgreSQL 14+) for zero-downtime archival; avoid updating partition keys (requires `ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT` and causes DELETE/INSERT overhead); run `ANALYZE` on new partitions immediately to update planner statistics; monitor for partition bloat and default partition growth indicating incomplete partitioning logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 14, we will dive into indexing and query performance\u2014covering B-tree internals, multi-column index strategies, covering indexes, specialized index types (GIN, GiST, BRIN), and the art of reading and optimizing execution plans with EXPLAIN."
