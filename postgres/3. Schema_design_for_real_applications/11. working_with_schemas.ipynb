    "# Chapter 11: Working with Schemas (Namespaces)\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL schemas provide logical namespaces within a database, enabling multi-tenancy, service boundaries, and security isolation without the overhead of separate database connections. This chapter covers architectural patterns, security configurations, and operational practices for production schema management.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 11.1.1 Understanding Schemas as Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "A schema is a named collection of database objects (tables, views, functions, indexes). Schemas prevent naming collisions and enable logical separation within a single database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "### 11.1.2 The Public Schema and Security Hardening\n",

    "-- Step 2: If using schema-per-tenant, consider dropping public entirely\n",
    "-- DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;  -- Destructive: removes all objects in public\n",

    "-- Alternative: Lock down public for specific roles only\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schema Fundamentals**: Schemas are namespaces preventing naming collisions; always use schema-qualified names (`schema.table`) in production code; revoke `CREATE` privileges on `public` schema to prevent unauthorized object creation and schema squatting attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-Tenant Patterns**: Schema-per-tenant provides strong isolation suitable for strict compliance requirements (customizable per tenant, easy backup/restore), but consider Row-Level Security (RLS) for high tenant counts (1000+ schemas impact catalog performance); never rely on `search_path` for tenant isolation—use explicit qualification or secure wrapper functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bounded Contexts**: Use schemas to enforce microservice boundaries within shared databases; create `api` schemas exposing only necessary views/functions while keeping `internal` schemas private; implement the outbox pattern in dedicated schemas for cross-service communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Search Path Security**: Set `search_path` explicitly to prevent schema squatting attacks; use empty or minimal search paths (`\"$user\"`) and force fully qualified names; always specify `SET search_path` in security-definer functions to prevent privilege escalation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Privilege Management**: Grant `USAGE` on schemas to enable object access; use `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` to automate permissions on new objects; create schema-specific roles for defense-in-depth; remember that `USAGE` on schema is required before any object-level permissions work.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cross-Schema Integration**: Foreign keys work across schemas but create tight coupling—consider triggers or application-level validation for loose coupling; use materialized views in dedicated analytics schemas to aggregate cross-schema data without impacting OLTP performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Operational Practices**: Track per-schema migrations in a dedicated schema; use `pg_dump -n` for schema-specific backups; monitor per-schema bloat and size distribution; ensure connection poolers properly handle schema context or reset search paths on connection checkout.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 12, we will explore views and materialized views—covering when to use each type, security barrier views, refresh strategies for materialized views, and indexing strategies for derived data sets."
