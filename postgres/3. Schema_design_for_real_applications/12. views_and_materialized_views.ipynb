    "# Chapter 12: Views and Materialized Views\n",
    "\n",
    "Views provide abstraction layers over base tables, enabling simplified queries, security restrictions, and schema evolution without breaking applications. Materialized views extend this concept with physical storage for query acceleration. This chapter covers implementation patterns, refresh strategies, and security considerations for production PostgreSQL environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.1 Regular Views (Virtual Tables)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.1.1 Creating and Using Views\n",
    "\n",
    "Views are stored queries that execute dynamically—no data is stored, only the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Basic view: Simplify complex joins\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW customer_order_summary AS\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    c.customer_id,\n",
    "    c.email,\n",
    "    c.full_name,\n",
    "    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as total_orders,\n",
    "    COALESCE(SUM(o.total_cents), 0) as lifetime_value_cents,\n",
    "    MAX(o.created_at) as last_order_date\n",
    "FROM customers c\n",
    "LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id \n",
    "                  AND o.status != 'cancelled'\n",
    "WHERE c.deleted_at IS NULL\n",
    "GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.email, c.full_name;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Usage: Query like a table\n",
    "SELECT * FROM customer_order_summary \n",
    "WHERE lifetime_value_cents > 100000\n",
    "ORDER BY lifetime_value_cents DESC;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- View expansion: PostgreSQL rewrites the query\n",
    "-- The above becomes:\n",
    "-- SELECT * FROM (underlying query) WHERE lifetime_value_cents > 100000;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Column aliases and explicit typing\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW product_catalog AS\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    p.product_id,\n",
    "    p.sku,\n",
    "    p.name as product_name,\n",
    "    p.base_price_cents,\n",
    "    ROUND(p.base_price_cents / 100.0, 2) as base_price_dollars,\n",
    "    c.name as category_name,\n",
    "    s.supplier_name\n",

    "-- Benefits:\n",
    "-- 1. API stability: Applications query catalog, not underlying tables\n",
    "-- 2. Security: Hide price calculation logic, sensitive columns\n",
    "-- 3. Maintenance: Change table structure, update view definition, apps unaffected\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regular Views**: Create abstraction layers over complex joins and calculations; automatically updatable when simple (single table, no aggregates), but require `INSTEAD OF` triggers for complex multi-table views; use `WITH CHECK OPTION` to prevent updates that would exclude rows from the view's result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Security Barriers**: Use `WITH (security_barrier)` to prevent malicious functions from accessing rows filtered by the view's WHERE clause—essential for implementing row-level security via views; note that security barriers prevent predicate pushdown and may impact performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Materialized Views**: Store physical snapshots of expensive queries for read-heavy workloads; require `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` to update data; use `CONCURRENTLY` option (requires unique index) to allow reads during refresh without blocking; choose refresh strategies based on data volatility—scheduled cron jobs for hourly/daily refreshes, application-triggered refreshes for near-real-time requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Indexing Strategy**: Create unique indexes on materialized views to enable concurrent refresh; add covering indexes for common access patterns; remember that indexes increase refresh time but dramatically improve query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Schema Evolution**: Use views as compatibility layers during migrations—expose old column names/computed columns via views while migrating underlying schema; drop views after all dependent applications are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Operational Considerations**: Monitor materialized view staleness and storage consumption; use `pg_stat_user_tables` to identify unused views consuming resources; plan maintenance windows for large view refreshes that cannot use `CONCURRENTLY`; consider the atomic swap pattern for zero-downtime materialized view updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 13, we will explore declarative partitioning—covering range, list, and hash partitioning strategies, partition pruning, partition-wise joins, and managing rolling windows of time-series data."
