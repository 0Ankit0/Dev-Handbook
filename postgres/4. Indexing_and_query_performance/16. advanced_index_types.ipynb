    "While B-tree indexes handle most OLTP workloads, specialized data types and query patterns require alternative index structures. This chapter covers PostgreSQL's advanced index types\u2014Hash, GIN, GiST, BRIN, and SP-GiST\u2014detailing their architectures, optimal use cases, and operational considerations for production environments.\n",

    "## 16.1 Hash Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash indexes store hash codes of values rather than the values themselves, enabling fast equality lookups with minimal storage overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.1.1 Architecture and Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create hash index (syntax only, use cases discussed below)\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_hash ON users USING HASH (email);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Hash index structure:\n",
    "-- 1. Hash function converts column value to 32-bit hash code\n",
    "-- 2. Buckets store hash codes pointing to heap tuples\n",
    "-- 3. Collision handling: Multiple values may hash to same bucket (chaining)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Critical historical note:\n",
    "-- Before PostgreSQL 10: Hash indexes were not WAL-logged\n",
    "-- - Not replicated to standbys\n",
    "-- - Lost on crash recovery (needed manual rebuild)\n",
    "-- PostgreSQL 10+: Full WAL support, replication safe\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Current limitations (all versions):\n",
    "-- 1. Only supports equality operators (=)\n",
    "-- 2. No support for ORDER BY, range queries, or pattern matching\n",
    "-- 3. No multi-column indexes\n",
    "-- 4. No unique constraints\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hash Indexes**: Store 32-bit hash codes for equality lookups only. Smaller than B-tree but limited to `=` operations. Replicated safely since PostgreSQL 10, but rarely necessary as B-tree equality performance is comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)**: Inverted index structure ideal for containment queries. Use for JSONB (`@>`), arrays (`&&`, `@>`), and full-text search (`@@`). Supports `jsonb_path_ops` for smaller, faster containment indexes (but no key existence operators). Uses pending list for fast updates (configurable via `fastupdate` storage parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GiST (Generalized Search Tree)**: Balanced tree framework for non-scalar data. Essential for range types (`&&` overlap), nearest-neighbor searches (`<->` distance operator), and trigram fuzzy matching. Lossy index requiring heap rechecks for some operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **BRIN (Block Range INdex)**: Stores min/max summaries for page ranges. Extremely small (MBs vs GBs for B-tree) and fast to create. Requires high correlation (>0.9) between physical storage and indexed value (natural for time-series). Ideal for append-only time-series data on `TIMESTAMPTZ` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned GiST)**: Partitioned tree structure for hierarchical data. Optimal for text prefix matching (trie structure) and network addresses (Patricia trie for IP containment). Lower memory footprint than GiST for specific access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Operational Considerations**: GIN indexes require monitoring of pending lists (vacuum frequency). GiST indexes are lossy (recheck overhead). BRIN requires correlation maintenance (avoid random inserts). All advanced indexes have specific query operator requirements\u2014ensure queries match index capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 17, we will explore EXPLAIN Like You Mean It\u2014covering detailed plan interpretation, buffer analysis, timing breakdowns, and methodologies for diagnosing plan instability and performance regression."
