    "# Chapter 15: Index Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes are the primary tool for query optimization in PostgreSQL, but they come with significant trade-offs. This chapter establishes the foundational knowledge required to design, implement, and maintain B-tree indexes\u2014the default and most common index type\u2014while understanding their costs and limitations in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15.1 B-Tree Index Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL uses Lehman-Yao B+-trees for standard indexes. Understanding their structure explains why certain queries use indexes while others cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.1.1 How B-Tree Indexes Work\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create a standard B-tree index\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- B-tree structure visualization (conceptual):\n",
    "-- Root Node (Level 2)\n",
    "--   [A-M] -> Intermediate Node\n",
    "--   [N-Z] -> Intermediate Node\n",
    "--\n",
    "-- Intermediate Node (Level 1)\n",
    "--   [A-F] -> Leaf Block 1\n",
    "--   [G-M] -> Leaf Block 2\n",
    "--\n",
    "-- Leaf Nodes (Level 0) - Doubly linked list\n",
    "--   Block 1: [alice@, bob@, charlie@, david@, emma@, frank@]\n",
    "--   Block 2: [george@, henry@, ...]\n",
    "--   Block 3: [nancy@, oscar@, ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Key properties:\n",
    "-- 1. Balanced tree: All leaf nodes at same depth (O(log n) lookup)\n",
    "-- 2. Leaf nodes contain actual index entries (value + ctid pointer)\n",
    "-- 3. Leaf nodes linked left-to-right (enables fast range scans)\n",
    "-- 4. Non-leaf nodes contain routing information (high keys)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Index entry format in leaf:\n",
    "-- (email_value, ctid) -> e.g., ('alice@example.com', '(0,15)')\n",
    "-- ctid = (block_number, row_offset) - physical row location\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.1.2 Index Pages and Fill Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- B-tree pages default to 8KB (same as heap pages)\n",
    "-- Default fillfactor: 90% for B-trees (leaves room for inserts)\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_ff ON users(email) WITH (fillfactor = 70);\n",
    "-- Lower fillfactor (e.g., 70%) leaves more room for inserts\n",
    "-- Reduces page splits on write-heavy tables\n",
    "-- Trade-off: Index becomes larger (more pages to scan)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- When to adjust fillfactor:\n",
    "-- 1. Static tables (no updates): fillfactor = 100 (most compact)\n",
    "-- 2. Heavy insert at end (sequences): fillfactor = 90 (default, good)\n",
    "-- 3. Random updates (UUIDs, random strings): fillfactor = 70-80\n",
    "-- 4. Heavy update workload: fillfactor = 50 (extreme, rarely needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Check index size and bloat:\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    schemaname,\n",
    "    tablename,\n",
    "    indexrelname as index_name,\n",
    "    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as index_size,\n",

    "## 15.2 When to Index (and When Not To)\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes accelerate reads but slow down writes and consume disk space. Industry standards dictate selective indexing based on query patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.2.1 Index Selection Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Cardinality rule: Index columns with high cardinality (many distinct values)\n",
    "-- Low cardinality (boolean, status with few values) rarely benefits from B-tree\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Good candidates for indexing:\n",

    "-- 2. Foreign keys (should be indexed for JOIN performance)\n",
    "-- 3. Frequently filtered columns in WHERE clauses\n",
    "-- 4. Columns used in ORDER BY (avoids sort)\n",
    "-- 5. Columns used in JOIN conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Example: E-commerce order queries\n",
    "-- High cardinality: order_id, email, tracking_number (good indexes)\n",
    "-- Low cardinality: status (pending/shipped/delivered), is_paid (boolean)\n",

    "-- If selectivity < 1%, partial index (WHERE clause) may be better\n",
    "-- If selectivity < 0.1%, B-tree probably useless (consider bitmap or no index)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Anti-pattern: Indexing low cardinality without partial predicate\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders(status);  -- Usually bad\n",
    "-- If status has 3 values and evenly distributed, index returns 33% of table\n",
    "-- Sequential scan often faster (sequential I/O vs random I/O)\n",

    "### 15.6.1 Unique Indexes and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Unique constraint (preferred method):\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT users_email_unique UNIQUE (email);\n",
    "-- Creates unique index automatically named users_email_unique\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Explicit unique index (if you want custom name):\n",
    "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_email_unique ON users(email);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Partial unique indexes (conditional uniqueness):\n",
    "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_active_email ON users(email) \n",
    "WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;\n",
    "-- Only active users must have unique emails\n",
    "-- Allows: 'alice@' deleted, new 'alice@' inserted later\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Unique index with INCLUDE:\n",
    "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email) INCLUDE (created_at);\n",
    "-- Enforces uniqueness on email, but covers created_at for index-only scans\n",
    "-- Note: INCLUDE columns don't affect uniqueness (only key columns do)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Handling NULLs in unique indexes:\n",
    "-- PostgreSQL considers NULL != NULL (standard SQL)\n",
    "-- Multiple NULL values allowed in unique index\n",
    "-- If you need to prevent multiple NULLs:\n",
    "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_phone_not_null ON users(phone) \n",
    "WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.6.2 Expression Indexes and Functional Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Index on expression (function-based index):\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_lower ON users(LOWER(email));\n",
    "-- Supports case-insensitive lookups efficiently:\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE LOWER(email) = LOWER('Alice@Example.com');\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Text search normalization:\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_users_name_trgm ON users USING GIN(name gin_trgm_ops);\n",
    "-- But for exact normalized matches, use expression index:\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_users_normalized_phone ON users(REGEXP_REPLACE(phone, '[^0-9]', '', 'g'));\n",
    "-- Supports: SELECT * FROM users WHERE REGEXP_REPLACE(phone, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') = '5551234567';\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Date extraction indexes (avoid if possible, prefer range queries):\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_orders_month ON orders(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at));\n",
    "-- Supports: WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) = 12\n",
    "-- But better approach: Index on created_at, query with ranges\n",
    "-- Only use expression index if range query not possible\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Immutable functions required:\n",
    "-- Index functions must be IMMUTABLE (same input always same output)\n",
    "-- NOW() is not immutable (changes over time), use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in defaults, not indexes\n",
    "-- LOWER() is immutable (good)\n",
    "-- Random() is not immutable (cannot index)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Check function volatility:\n",
    "SELECT provolatile FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'lower';  -- Returns 'i' (immutable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15.7 Indexing Strategy Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.7.1 Foreign Key Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Foreign keys should always be indexed (not automatic in PostgreSQL)\n",
    "-- Without index on FK, DELETE on parent table requires sequential scan of child\n",
    "-- Example: orders.user_id references users.user_id\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Parent table (users) - has PK index automatically\n",
    "-- Child table (orders) - needs index for FK:\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Why this matters:\n",
    "-- DELETE FROM users WHERE user_id = 123;\n",
    "-- PostgreSQL must check if any orders reference user 123\n",
    "-- Without index: Seq Scan on orders (slow for large tables)\n",
    "-- With index: Index Scan on orders (fast)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Composite FKs need composite indexes:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE order_items \n",
    "ADD CONSTRAINT fk_order_items_order \n",
    "FOREIGN KEY (order_id, tenant_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id, tenant_id);\n",
    "-- Create matching index:\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_order_tenant ON order_items(order_id, tenant_id);\n",
    "-- Order must match FK column order exactly for the check to use index efficiently\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.7.2 Indexing for Sorting (ORDER BY)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Indexes can avoid sort operations:\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created_sort ON orders(created_at DESC, order_id DESC);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Query that benefits:\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders \n",
    "WHERE user_id = 123 \n",
    "ORDER BY created_at DESC \n",
    "LIMIT 10;\n",
    "-- Index Scan backwards (if index is (user_id, created_at))\n",
    "-- Or Index Scan if composite matches exactly\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Mixed sort directions:\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_orders_mixed ON orders(user_id ASC, created_at DESC);\n",
    "-- Supports: WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY created_at DESC\n",
    "-- Does not support: WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY created_at ASC (backwards scan possible though)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- NULL ordering:\n",
    "-- Default: NULLS LAST for ASC, NULLS FIRST for DESC\n",
    "-- If query uses NULLS FIRST/LAST explicitly, match index:\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_orders_nulls ON orders(priority NULLS FIRST);\n",
    "-- Supports: ORDER BY priority NULLS FIRST\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.7.3 Indexing for LIKE Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- B-tree indexes support LIKE only with prefix patterns:\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_prefix ON users(email);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Works (can use index):\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE 'alice@%';\n",
    "-- Range scan: email >= 'alice@' AND email < 'alice@' || chr(127)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Does NOT work (cannot use B-tree index):\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com';\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%alice%';\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Solution for suffix/pattern matching: Trigram indexes (GIN/GiST)\n",
    "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_trgm ON users USING GIN(email gin_trgm_ops);\n",
    "-- Now supports: email LIKE '%@example.com' (efficiently)\n",
    "-- Supports: email ILIKE '%ALICE%' (case insensitive)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Pattern matching with wildcards in middle:\n",
    "-- B-tree: Not supported\n",
    "-- Trigram: Supported but slower than prefix\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "-- 1. Verify index is used (check with EXPLAIN)\n",
    "EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = 'value';\n",
    "-- Ensure Index Scan or Index Only Scan appears, not Seq Scan (unless small table)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- 2. Check for duplicate indexes:\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    t.tablename,\n",
    "    array_agg(i.indexname ORDER BY i.indexname) as indexes,\n",
    "    pg_size_pretty(sum(pg_relation_size(i.indexname::regclass))) as total_size\n",

    "HAVING count(*) > 1;\n",
    "-- Remove redundant indexes (exact duplicates or (a) vs (a,b) where (a) is redundant)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- 3. Validate foreign key indexes:\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    tc.table_name,\n",
    "    kcu.column_name,\n",
    "    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table,\n",
    "    CASE \n",
    "        WHEN EXISTS (\n",
    "            SELECT 1 FROM pg_indexes \n",
    "            WHERE tablename = tc.table_name \n",
    "            AND indexdef LIKE '%(' || kcu.column_name || ')%'\n",
    "        ) THEN 'Indexed'\n",
    "        ELSE 'MISSING INDEX'\n",

    "### 15.8.2 Common Indexing Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Mistake 1: Indexing every column\n",
    "-- Creates write amplification nightmare\n",
    "-- Rule: Index only columns that appear in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Mistake 2: Indexing columns with heavy updates\n",
    "-- Indexes on updated_at, last_login cause constant index churn\n",
    "-- Consider if queries actually benefit vs cost\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Mistake 3: Using indexes for small tables\n",
    "-- Tables < 1000 rows usually don't benefit (sequential scan faster)\n",
    "-- Exception: Unique constraints require indexes regardless\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Mistake 4: Leading wildcard LIKE without trigram\n",
    "-- idx_email with LIKE '%domain.com' won't use index\n",
    "-- Must use pg_trgm extension for suffix matching\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Mistake 5: Composite index with wrong column order\n",
    "-- Index on (created_at, status) won't help WHERE status = 'x'\n",
    "-- Must match query patterns: equality columns first, then range\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Mistake 6: Ignoring partial indexes for low cardinality\n",
    "-- Index on status (3 values) is wasteful\n",
    "-- Partial index WHERE status = 'rare_value' is efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Mistake 7: Not using CONCURRENTLY in production\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table(column);  -- Locks table!\n",
    "-- Always use:\n",
    "CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_name ON table(column);\n",
    "-- Slower (two passes) but no blocking\n",
    "-- Cannot run inside transaction block\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Mistake 8: Index bloat blindness\n",
    "-- Never running REINDEX on high-churn tables\n",
    "-- Schedule regular REINDEX CONCURRENTLY for heavily updated indexes\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **B-Tree Architecture**: PostgreSQL uses B+-trees with leaf pages containing (value, ctid) pairs linked in sorted order. Tree depth remains balanced (O(log n)) for consistent lookup performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Index Selection**: Index columns with high cardinality (many distinct values). Low cardinality columns (booleans, enums) require partial indexes (WHERE clause) to be effective. Every index adds write overhead\u2014INSERT/UPDATE operations slow proportionally to index count.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Column Indexes**: Column order follows the leftmost prefix rule. Place equality columns (=) first, range columns (>, <) second. Index can satisfy queries using the leftmost subset of columns, but not queries skipping leading columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Covering Indexes (INCLUDE)**: Store additional columns in leaf pages only (not tree structure) to enable Index-Only Scans. Key columns determine tree organization; included columns provide payload for visibility without heap access. Reduces I/O but avoid including large text or frequently updated columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Index Maintenance**: Indexes bloat from UPDATE/DELETE operations. Dead space accumulates until VACUUM reclaims it. Use `REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to rebuild bloated indexes without downtime. Monitor `pg_stat_user_indexes` for usage patterns and bloat indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Specialized Features**: Unique indexes enforce constraints; partial unique indexes enforce conditional uniqueness (e.g., active emails only). Expression indexes support functional lookups (LOWER(email)) but require immutable functions. Foreign keys must be manually indexed for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 16, we will explore Advanced Index Types\u2014covering GIN and GiST for full-text search and JSONB, BRIN for large time-series tables, and specialized indexes for ranges and arrays."
