    "# Chapter 17: EXPLAIN Like You Mean It\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading execution plans is the definitive skill for PostgreSQL performance tuning. This chapter transforms EXPLAIN output from cryptic text into actionable intelligence, covering interpretation methodologies, buffer analysis, anti-pattern detection, and statistical rigor when validating optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17.1 EXPLAIN Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL provides multiple EXPLAIN modes that serve different diagnostic purposes. Understanding when to use each format prevents misinterpretation of performance characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.1.1 EXPLAIN vs EXPLAIN ANALYZE\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- EXPLAIN (estimates only): Shows planner's cost model predictions\n",
    "EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 123;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Output:\n",
    "-- Index Scan using users_pkey on users  (cost=0.29..8.30 rows=1 width=72)\n",
    "--   Index Cond: (user_id = 123)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Key characteristics:\n",
    "-- - No query execution (fast, safe on production)\n",
    "-- - Shows estimated costs (arbitrary units) and row counts\n",
    "-- - Reveals chosen plan without runtime overhead\n",
    "-- - Cannot detect runtime issues (memory spills, lock contention)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- EXPLAIN ANALYZE (actual execution): Runs query and compares estimates to reality\n",
    "EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 123;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Output adds:\n",
    "-- (actual time=0.012..0.013 rows=1 loops=1)\n",
    "-- Planning Time: 0.150 ms\n",
    "-- Execution Time: 0.025 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Critical differences:\n",
    "-- - Actually executes the query (writes happen, locks acquired)\n",
    "-- - Shows actual time (milliseconds) and actual row counts\n",
    "-- - Planning Time: Parser + Rewriter + Planner duration\n",
    "-- - Execution Time: Executor runtime (excluding planning)\n",
    "-- - loops: How many times node executed (crucial for nested loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- DANGER: EXPLAIN ANALYZE executes writes!\n",
    "EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) DELETE FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending';\n",
    "-- Actually deletes rows! Use transactions for safety:\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) DELETE FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending';\n",
    "ROLLBACK;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS): Adds I/O statistics (essential for performance)\n",
    "EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 123;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Additional output:\n",
    "-- Buffers: shared hit=3\n",
    "-- - shared hit: Block found in shared buffer cache (fast)\n",
    "-- - shared read: Block read from disk (slow)\n",
    "-- - shared dirtied: Block modified in cache\n",
    "-- - shared written: Block written to disk by checkpoint/bgwriter\n",
    "-- - local hits/read: For temporary tables\n",
    "-- - temp read/write: For work_mem spills to disk\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.1.2 Output Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- TEXT (default): Human-readable, compact\n",
    "EXPLAIN (FORMAT TEXT) SELECT * FROM users;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- JSON (machine-readable, programmatic analysis):\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **EXPLAIN Modes**: `EXPLAIN` shows planner estimates (no execution); `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` executes and shows actuals; `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` adds I/O statistics essential for performance analysis. Always use `BUFFERS` for disk I/O visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Plan Reading**: Read bottom-up (leaf scans to root). Indentation indicates parent-child relationships. `actual time=X..Y` shows first-row and total time; `loops=N` indicates iteration count (critical for nested loops); `rows=N` vs `actual rows=M` reveals estimation errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Buffer Analysis**: `shared hit` = cache reads (fast); `shared read` = disk reads (slow). High `shared read` with index scans indicates cache misses or random I/O. `external merge` or `Batches: 2+` indicates `work_mem` spills to disk (performance killer).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Anti-Patterns**: Functions on columns prevent index usage (use functional indexes or rewrite queries); implicit type conversions cause `to_char()` or casting on columns; leading wildcards (`%text`) require trigram indexes; `OR` conditions across columns force sequential scans (use `UNION` instead); `OFFSET` pagination is O(n) (use keyset pagination).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Plan Stability**: Parameter sniffing occurs when generic plans optimized for one parameter value perform poorly for others. Use `plan_cache_mode = 'force_custom_plan'` for variable data distributions. Stale statistics cause cardinality misestimates (red rows in Depesz); run `ANALYZE` after significant data changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Measurement Rigor**: Single timings are noise; measure buffer counts (deterministic) over wall-clock time where possible. Warm caches before benchmarking. Account for planning time in complex views. Test at production scale and concurrency, not just single-user EXPLAIN.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Chapter 18, we will explore Performance Tuning Playbook—covering query refactoring patterns, index selection workflows, batch operations, N+1 elimination strategies, and practical checklists for slow endpoint diagnosis."
