    "\n",
    "Documentation is not ancillary to database engineering\u2014it is infrastructure. Without explicit standards, teams accumulate technical debt through inconsistent naming, unchecked query patterns, and tribal knowledge that vanishes when engineers depart. This chapter provides production-ready templates for SQL style conventions, review procedures, and operational runbooks that transform individual expertise into organizational capability.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 48.2.1 Pre-Commit Checklist (Developer Self-Review)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting a migration for peer review, verify:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "## Schema Change Self-Review Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness\n",
    "- [ ] All tables have primary keys (surrogate UUID or BIGINT, never natural keys alone)\n",
    "- [ ] Foreign keys have matching data types and collations\n",
    "- [ ] Check constraints use immutable functions only\n",
    "- [ ] Default values match column types (e.g., `NOW()` for `TIMESTAMPTZ`, not `TIMESTAMP`)\n",
    "- [ ] Enum values are comprehensive (include 'unknown' or 'other' if applicable)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance\n",
    "- [ ] Indexes added for all foreign key columns (unless table < 1000 rows)\n",
    "- [ ] Composite indexes follow column ordering rules (equality first, range second)\n",
    "- [ ] Partial indexes use `WHERE` conditions matching common queries\n",
    "- [ ] Large text columns use `TEXT` not `VARCHAR(n)` (no performance difference, better compatibility)\n",
    "- [ ] JSONB preferred over JSON for indexing and querying\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety\n",
    "- [ ] New columns added as nullable OR with defaults (never `NOT NULL` without default on existing tables)\n",
    "- [ ] Dangerous operations (DROP COLUMN, RENAME) use Expand-Contract pattern documented\n",
    "- [ ] `ON DELETE` specified for all foreign keys (default is RESTRICT, consider CASCADE carefully)\n",
    "- [ ] Column removal preceded by application code deprecation (dual-write period confirmed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security\n",
    "- [ ] No plaintext passwords or secrets in schema\n",
    "- [ ] PII columns marked with comments\n",
    "- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) policies added if table contains user data\n",
    "- [ ] Default privileges reviewed for new schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintainability\n",
    "- [ ] Consistent naming conventions followed (see Style Guide 48.1)\n",
    "- [ ] Comments added for all objects\n",
    "- [ ] Migration is idempotent (can run multiple times without error)\n",
    "- [ ] Down migration tested (if using reversible migration tool)\n",

    "\n",
    "Deep review for production safety:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "## Production Schema Review Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Integrity\n",
    "- [ ] **Cardinality Check**: Foreign key relationships match business logic (1:1, 1:N, M:N correctly modeled)\n",
    "- [ ] **Temporal Integrity**: Timezone handling consistent (`TIMESTAMPTZ` vs `TIMESTAMP`), no mixing\n",
    "- [ ] **Constraint Validation**: Check constraints handle edge cases (empty strings, zero values, extreme dates)\n",
    "- [ ] **Uniqueness Scope**: Unique constraints account for soft deletes (use partial indexes `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locking and Downtime\n",
    "- [ ] **Lock Duration**: `ALTER TABLE` operations estimated for table size (<1s for <1M rows, <5s for <10M rows)\n",
    "- [ ] **Concurrent Index Creation**: New indexes use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (not blocking)\n",
    "- [ ] **Constraint Validation**: Foreign keys added as `NOT VALID` then `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` in separate transaction\n",
    "- [ ] **Table Rewrite Avoidance**: Verify `ALTER` doesn't force table rewrite (check `pg_catalog` for \"requires rewrite\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalability\n",
    "- [ ] **Partitioning Strategy**: Tables >100GB or >100M rows have partitioning plan\n",
    "- [ ] **TOAST Evaluation**: Large columns (>2KB) understood and acceptable\n",
    "- [ ] **Autovacuum Tuning**: High-churn tables have custom autovacuum settings\n",
    "- [ ] **Connection Impact**: New sequences have appropriate cache size for high-insert scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observability\n",
    "- [ ] **Monitoring Alerts**: New tables added to \"table bloat\" monitoring dashboard\n",
    "- [ ] **SLA Alignment**: Slow query thresholds defined for new access patterns\n",
    "- [ ] **Dependency Documentation**: Downstream ETL/data warehouse impact assessed\n",

    "- [ ] **No Seq Scans** on tables >10,000 rows (unless intentionally full-table scan)\n",
    "- [ ] **Index Usage**: Bitmap scans acceptable, but verify bitmap heap ratio\n",
    "- [ ] **Join Order**: Smallest result set joined first (check with `SET join_collapse_limit = 1` if uncertain)\n",
    "- [ ] **Sort Operations**: In-memory sorts only (`Sort Method: quicksort`), no disk sorts\n",
    "- [ ] **Parallelism**: Queries >100ms utilize parallel workers if beneficial\n",

    "### Resource Consumption\n",
    "- [ ] **Execution Time**: <50ms for OLTP (user-facing), <5s for reporting\n",
    "- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Work_mem sufficient (no `Disk Spool` operations)\n",

    "### Correctness\n",
    "- [ ] **NULL Handling**: Three-valued logic considered (`NULL != NULL` evaluated correctly)\n",
    "- [ ] **Duplicate Check**: Joins don't produce Cartesian products (verify row counts)\n",
    "- [ ] **Time Zone**: `TIMESTAMPTZ` used consistently, no mixing with `TIMESTAMP`\n",
    "- [ ] **Collation**: Text comparisons specify collation if locale-dependent sorting required\n",

    "|-------|----------|---------------|------------|\n",
    "| SEV1 | Complete outage, data loss, corruption | 5 minutes | Immediate CEO/CTO |\n",
    "| SEV2 | Degraded performance (>5s latency) | 15 minutes | Engineering Manager |\n",
    "| SEV3 | Single replica failure, non-critical alerts | 1 hour | On-call DBA |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Response (First 5 Minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assess Scope**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- Check current connections and activity\n",
    "   SELECT count(*), state FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY state;\n",
    "   \n",
    "   -- Check replication lag\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Communication**\n",
    "   - Post in #incidents channel: \"Investigating database [symptom]\"\n",
    "   - Create incident bridge call if SEV1/SEV2\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Safety First**\n",
    "   - Do NOT restart primary without understanding root cause\n",
    "   - Do NOT kill queries indiscriminately (may be replication processes)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario A: Lock Contention (Queries hanging)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagnosis**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Find blocking queries\n",
    "SELECT blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,\n",
    "       blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,\n",
    "       blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,\n",
    "       blocking_activity.query AS blocking_statement\n",
    "FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks\n",
    "JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid\n",
    "JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks blocking_locks \n",
    "    ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype\n",
    "    AND blocking_locks.relation = blocked_locks.relation\n",
    "    AND blocking_locks.pid != blocked_locks.pid\n",
    "JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid\n",
    "WHERE NOT blocked_locks.granted;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resolution**:\n",
    "1. Identify if blocking query is legitimate (migration, batch job)\n",
    "2. If illegitimate: `SELECT pg_terminate_backend(blocking_pid);`\n",
    "3. If legitimate but stuck: Evaluate if safe to cancel or must wait\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario B: Disk Space Critical\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagnosis**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "df -h /var/lib/postgresql/data\n",
    "du -sh /var/lib/postgresql/data/pg_wal/* | sort -h | tail -10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immediate Actions**:\n",
    "1. Check replication slots: `SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;` (inactive slots cause WAL accumulation)\n",
    "2. If safe, drop inactive slots: `SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('slot_name');`\n",
    "3. Truncate logs if separate volume: Do NOT touch pg_wal directly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario C: Connection Exhaustion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immediate**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Increase max_connections temporarily (requires restart, so plan B):\n",
    "-- Instead, terminate idle connections:\n",
    "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) \n",
    "FROM pg_stat_activity \n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SQL Style Standards**: Enforce UPPERCASE keywords, lowercase identifiers with explicit `AS` aliases, trailing commas, and 4-space indentation; document all objects with comments explaining business purpose and PII classification; use consistent prefixes (`pk_`, `fk_`, `idx_`) for constraints and indexes to enable automated tooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schema Review Discipline**: Implement dual-phase reviews\u2014developer self-review (checking idempotency, NOT NULL safety, and index coverage) and senior/DBA review (verifying locking behavior, partition strategies, and backward compatibility); use automated safety scripts to detect unindexed foreign keys and missing primary keys before production deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Review Procedures**: Require `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` evidence for all production queries, enforce <50ms latency for OLTP workloads, prohibit sequential scans on large tables, and mandate keyset pagination for large result sets; maintain review templates that document execution plans, required indexes, and rollback strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Operational Runbooks**: Maintain living documents for incident response (including severity classifications, lock contention resolution, and disk space emergencies), scheduled maintenance (index bloat removal, statistics updates, log rotation), and access management (onboarding/offboarding procedures, break-glass protocols); ensure all runbooks include copy-paste SQL and commands tested against production-like environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes the **PostgreSQL Developer Handbook**. You now possess comprehensive knowledge spanning local development workflows, testing strategies, CI/CD automation, and operational standards required to build, deploy, and maintain production PostgreSQL systems at scale."
