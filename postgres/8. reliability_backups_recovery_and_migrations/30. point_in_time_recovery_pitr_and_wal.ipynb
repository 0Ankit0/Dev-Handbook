    "# Chapter 30: Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) and WAL\n",
    "\n",
    "Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) transforms PostgreSQL from a simple backup-and-restore system into a continuous data protection platform. By combining physical base backups with a complete archive of Write-Ahead Log (WAL) files, you can recover a database to any microsecond between the backup time and the present\u2014or even to a specific transaction. This chapter covers the architectural foundations of WAL, the mechanics of continuous archiving, and the operational procedures for achieving granular recovery objectives.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 30.1 WAL Architecture and MVCC\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30.1.1 The Write-Ahead Log Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL's durability guarantee rests on the WAL (Write-Ahead Log), a sequential record of all changes made to the database's data files. Before any data page is written to disk, the corresponding WAL record describing that change must be durably stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Principles**:\n",
    "1. **Sequential Write Performance**: WAL is append-only, avoiding random I/O penalties of data file updates\n",
    "2. **Crash Recovery**: On startup, PostgreSQL replays WAL from the last checkpoint to bring data files to a consistent state\n",
    "3. **Replication**: Streaming replication transmits WAL records to standby servers\n",
    "4. **PITR**: Archived WAL files extend recovery beyond the last checkpoint to any historical point\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Check WAL configuration and current position\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    current_setting('wal_level') as wal_level,\n",
    "    current_setting('archive_mode') as archive_mode,\n",
    "    pg_current_wal_lsn() as current_lsn,\n",
    "    pg_walfile_name(pg_current_wal_lsn()) as current_wal_file,\n",
    "    pg_walfile_name_offset(pg_current_wal_lsn()) as file_offset;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**WAL File Format**:\n",
    "- Default size: 16MB (configurable via `initdb --wal-segsize`, or `wal_segment_size` in PG15+)\n",
    "- Naming convention: `TTTTTTTTXXXXXXXXYYYYYYYY` (timeline, logical ID, segment)\n",
    "- Location: `pg_wal/` (formerly `pg_xlog/` in PG 9.6 and earlier)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30.1.2 WAL Generation and Checkpointing\n",
    "\n",
    "WAL files are generated continuously and recycled in a ring buffer. Checkpoints truncate the recovery horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Monitor WAL generation rate\n",

    "## 30.2 WAL Archiving Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30.2.1 Archive Mode Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable PITR, PostgreSQL must copy completed WAL segments to archival storage before recycling them. This is controlled by `archive_mode` and `archive_command`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration** (postgresql.conf):\n",
    "\n",
    "```ini\n",
    "wal_level = replica          # Minimum for archiving (logical if using logical replication)\n",
    "archive_mode = on            # Enable archiving (always|off|on)\n",
    "                             # 'always' for standby servers to archive their own WAL\n",
    "\n",
    "# Archive command (must return 0 on success, non-zero to retry)\n",
    "# Simple local copy (testing only):\n",
    "archive_command = 'test ! -f /backups/wal/%f && cp %p /backups/wal/%f'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Production-ready with error handling and compression:\n",
    "archive_command = 'test ! -f /backups/wal/%f && gzip -c %p > /backups/wal/%f.gz && chmod 600 /backups/wal/%f.gz'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cloud storage (using wal-g - industry standard):\n",
    "archive_command = 'wal-g wal-push %p'\n",
    "\n",
    "# AWS S3 using AWS CLI (ensure instance profile or env vars configured):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Requirements**:\n",
    "1. **Zero Exit Code**: The command must return 0 only if the file is durably stored (fsynced to disk or confirmed in object storage)\n",
    "2. **Idempotency**: Running the command twice must not corrupt data (hence `test ! -f`)\n",
    "3. **Permissions**: The `postgres` OS user must have write access to the archive destination\n",
    "4. **Atomicity**: Use temporary files and atomic moves to prevent partial files: `cp %p /backups/wal/%f.tmp && mv /backups/wal/%f.tmp /backups/wal/%f`\n",

    "\n",
    "### 30.6.1 Defining Recovery Objectives\n",

    "\n",
    "**Achieving RPO < 5 Minutes**:\n",
    "- Continuous archiving with `archive_timeout = 5min` (force archive switch every 5 minutes)\n",
    "- Streaming replication to standby (WAL applied continuously)\n",
    "- `pg_receivewal` running in parallel to stream WAL to secondary storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30.6.2 Calculating Recovery Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Recovery duration consists of:\n",
    "1. **Base restore**: Copy data files (network/disk bandwidth limited)\n",
    "2. **WAL replay**: Proportional to time since backup and write volume\n",
    "3. **Warmup**: Cache warming, index validation (if applicable)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Estimate WAL replay speed (typically 100MB/s to 1GB/s depending on hardware)\n",
    "pg_waldump --stats /backups/wal/0000000100000001* | tail -20\n",

    "# Check how much WAL needs replay:\n",
    "ls -la /backups/wal/*.gz | wc -l  # Number of files since backup\n",
    "# Multiply by 16MB (uncompressed) for total bytes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization**:\n",
    "- Take base backups frequently (daily) to reduce WAL replay window\n",
    "- Use `pg_basebackup` with `--wal-method=fetch` to include necessary WAL in backup\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **WAL Architecture**: The Write-Ahead Log provides durability, replication, and PITR capabilities. WAL files (16MB default) are generated continuously and must be archived before recycling to enable historical recovery. Use `pg_stat_archiver` to monitor archiving lag.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Archive Configuration**: Set `wal_level = replica`, `archive_mode = on`, and configure `archive_command` to copy WAL to durable storage (S3, NFS, Azure Blob). Commands must be idempotent, return exit code 0 only on success, and use atomic file operations. Use tools like `wal-g` or `pgBackRest` for cloud-native archiving.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PITR Workflow**: Restore a base backup, create `recovery.signal`, configure `restore_command` to fetch WAL, and set `recovery_target_time` (or XID/LSN/Name) in `postgresql.conf`. Start PostgreSQL; it replays WAL until the target, then pauses, promotes, or shuts down based on `recovery_target_action`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Timeline Management**: Each recovery creates a new timeline (numbered history files) to prevent divergence conflicts. Use `recovery_target_timeline` to specify which branch to follow. Create named restore points with `pg_create_restore_point()` for precise recovery markers during maintenance windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Recovery Targets**: Specify exact recovery points via timestamp (microsecond precision), transaction ID, LSN, or named restore point. Use `recovery_target_inclusive` to control boundary transaction inclusion. Always use `pause` action initially to verify state before `pg_promote()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **RPO/RTO Strategy**: Achieve aggressive RPO (minutes) via frequent base backups and continuous archiving. For RTO \u2248 0, maintain streaming replicas rather than relying on PITR. Calculate WAL retention as `(backup_interval + rpo_safety_margin) * daily_wal_volume`. Store archives in immutable storage (S3 Object Lock) to prevent ransomware corruption of backups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**: In Chapter 31, we will cover Schema Migrations in Real Teams\u2014exploring migration frameworks, zero-downtime deployment patterns, handling long-running migrations safely, and maintaining backward compatibility across application versions."
