    "# Chapter 29: Backup and Restore Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Data durability is the bedrock of production database operations. This chapter provides comprehensive coverage of PostgreSQL backup strategies\u2014from logical dumps suitable for migrations and selective restoration to physical backups for point-in-time recovery. We emphasize industry standards for backup verification, automation, and disaster recovery planning that satisfies enterprise compliance requirements (RTO/RPO objectives).\n",

    "## 29.1 Logical vs. Physical Backup Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL offers two distinct backup paradigms, each serving different operational needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29.1.1 Logical Backups (SQL Dumps)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**: Logical backups export database objects (schemas, tables, data) as SQL statements or archive formats. They are portable across PostgreSQL versions and architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Database migrations (major version upgrades, cloud transitions)\n",
    "- Selective table restoration\n",
    "- Schema-only backups for version control\n",
    "- Small to medium databases (< 1TB)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools**: `pg_dump` (single database), `pg_dumpall` (cluster-wide)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Basic logical backup (custom format - compressed, flexible)\n",
    "pg_dump -h prod-db.example.com -U backup_user -d production \\\n",
    "    -Fc -f production_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flags explained:\n",
    "# -Fc : Custom format (compressed, supports selective restore)\n",
    "# -Fd : Directory format (parallelizable, one file per table)\n",
    "# -Fp : Plain text SQL (human readable, larger size)\n",
    "# -Ft : Tar format (legacy, limited functionality)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29.1.2 Physical Backups (Filesystem Copy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**: Physical backups copy the actual data files (heap files, WAL segments) at the filesystem level. They preserve the exact binary state of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Large databases (> 1TB) where logical backup is too slow\n",
    "- Point-in-time recovery (PITR) requirements\n",
    "- Disaster recovery with minimal RTO\n",
    "- Replica seeding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools**: `pg_basebackup`, filesystem snapshots (LVM, ZFS, EBS, Azure Disk)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Basic physical backup (base backup for replication/PITR)\n",
    "pg_basebackup -h prod-db.example.com -U replicator \\\n",
    "    -D /backups/base/$(date +%Y%m%d) \\\n",
    "    -Fp -Xs -P -v\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flags explained:\n",
    "# -D : Destination directory\n",
    "# -Fp : Plain format (copy files as-is)\n",
    "# -Ft : Tar format (single tar file per tablespace)\n",
    "# -Xs : Stream WAL during backup (essential for consistency)\n",
    "# -P : Progress reporting\n",
    "# -v : Verbose\n",

    "PostgreSQL supports four output formats, each with specific operational characteristics.\n",

    "# -Z9 : Compression level 9 (highest)\n",
    "# -j 4 : Parallel dump jobs (requires directory format for tables, or pg_dump 12+)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Directory Format (-Fd) - Parallel Operations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Directory format (best for large databases)\n",
    "pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres -d production \\\n",
    "    -Fd -j 8 -Z 5 \\\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backup Types**: Logical backups (`pg_dump`) provide portability and granularity for migrations and table-level recovery; physical backups (`pg_basebackup`) provide fast disaster recovery and point-in-time recovery capability. Use logical for <1TB databases and migrations, physical for large production databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **pg_dump Best Practices**: Use custom format (`-Fc`) for flexibility, directory format (`-Fd`) with parallel jobs (`-j`) for large databases, and selective filtering (`--table`, `--exclude-table`) to manage size. Always use `--no-owner` and `--no-privileges` when restoring to different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **pg_restore Techniques**: Leverage parallel restoration (`-j`) for speed, use `--single-transaction` for atomicity on small databases, and employ `--disable-triggers` carefully during data-only restores. Inspect backups with `-l` before selective restoration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Physical Backup Architecture**: Configure `wal_level = replica` and `archive_mode = on` for PITR. Use `pg_basebackup` with `-Xs` to stream WAL during backup ensuring consistency. Store WAL archives separately from base backups.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Verification**: Implement automated restore drills that create ephemeral databases, verify row counts, check constraint validity, and test application connectivity. Use `pg_verifybackup` for physical backups. Untested backups are invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Large Database Strategy**: For multi-terabyte systems, use parallel directory format dumps, partition-specific backups (archiving old partitions separately), or physical backup tools like pgBackRest. Consider excluding large binary columns if separately stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Security**: Encrypt backups at rest using GPG or storage-level encryption (LUKS/SSE-KMS). Restrict backup user privileges to `REPLICATION` and `SELECT`. Maintain offsite, immutable backups (WORM) for ransomware protection and compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**: In Chapter 30, we will explore Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) and Write-Ahead Log (WAL) architecture\u2014covering WAL archiving strategies, recovery target specifications, timeline management, and achieving specific RPO (Recovery Point Objective) targets through continuous archiving."
