    "# Chapter 32: Upgrades and Major Version Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL's annual release cycle delivers significant performance improvements, security enhancements, and feature additions. However, major version upgrades (e.g., 15 → 16) modify the on-disk data format, requiring explicit migration procedures. This chapter covers the strategic planning, execution methods, and validation procedures for zero-downtime or minimal-downtime upgrades in production environments.\n",

    "**pg_dump/pg_restore**: Can drop new database and restore old one (data loss since cutover).\n",

    "**pg_upgrade with --link**: Cannot rollback—old data directory is hard-linked and modified. Must restore from pre-upgrade backup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pg_upgrade without --link**: Old data directory intact but requires downtime to switch back.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Before upgrade, create a replication slot for potential rollback\n",

    "Every upgrade must document:\n",
    "- Exact start time and target version\n",
    "- `pg_upgrade` output or migration logs\n",
    "- Post-upgrade validation results\n",
    "- Rollback decision point (time after which rollback is no longer viable)\n",
    "- Who performed the upgrade and who approved it\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Upgrade Strategies**: Choose `pg_dump/pg_restore` for small databases (<500GB) or cross-architecture migrations; `pg_upgrade` for large databases where downtime must be minimized; and logical replication for zero-downtime requirements. The `--link` mode in `pg_upgrade` provides the fastest upgrade but prevents rollback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **pg_upgrade Execution**: Install both PostgreSQL versions in parallel, initialize the new data directory with `initdb`, run `pg_upgrade` with appropriate `--jobs` parallelism, and execute the generated `analyze_new_cluster.sh` script. Never delete the old cluster until the new one has passed burn-in testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pre-Upgrade Validation**: Verify extension compatibility matrices, check for deprecated features (removed operators, changed defaults), ensure sufficient disk space (2x for copy mode), and confirm WAL archiving is current. Test the upgrade process on a production-sized staging environment first.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Post-Upgrade Procedures**: Run `ANALYZE` to rebuild statistics, update extensions (`ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE`), verify query plan stability, test application connectivity through connection pools, and monitor error logs for authentication or compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Rollback Planning**: Understand that `pg_upgrade --link` modifies the old data directory in place, making rollback impossible without pre-upgrade physical backups. Maintain logical replication slots or physical backups as escape hatches. Document the point of no return and ensure the team knows when rollback is no longer viable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extension Compatibility**: Major PostgreSQL versions often require extension updates. Check that PostGIS, TimescaleDB, and custom C extensions have versions compiled for the target PostgreSQL release. Rebuild extensions against new server headers when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**: In Chapter 33, we will explore Streaming Replication (Physical)—covering primary/standby architecture, synchronous vs asynchronous replication, replication slots and retention management, and failover basics with their operational caveats."
