    "## Chapter 10: Middleware and Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Middleware is a powerful mechanism that sits between the server and your application code, allowing you to process requests before they reach your endpoints and responses before they're sent to clients. Combined with lifespan events for startup and shutdown operations, these tools enable you to implement cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, error handling, and performance monitoring consistently across your entire application.\n",

    "### 10.1 Middleware Basics: Intercepting Requests and Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Middleware in FastAPI (powered by Starlette) is a function or class that processes every request before it reaches your path operation and every response before it leaves your application. This enables global behavior that applies to all endpoints.\n",

    "#### The `@app.middleware` Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to create middleware is using the `@app.middleware(\"http\")` decorator. This registers a function that will be called for every HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# middleware_basics.py\n",
    "import time\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        request: The incoming HTTP request object\n",
    "        call_next: A function that passes the request to the next handler\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        Response: The HTTP response from the endpoint\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    # === PRE-PROCESSING ===\n",
    "    # This code runs BEFORE the endpoint is called\n",
    "    \n",

    "    request_id = f\"req-{int(start_time * 1000)}\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Log the incoming request\n",
    "    print(f\"[{request_id}] --> {request.method} {request.url.path}\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Store request ID in state for use in endpoints\n",
    "    request.state.request_id = request_id\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # === CALL NEXT HANDLER ===\n",
    "    # This passes control to the next middleware or endpoint\n",
    "    # The endpoint processes the request and returns a response\n",
    "    response = await call_next(request)\n",
    "    \n",

    "    # This code runs AFTER the endpoint returns a response\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Calculate processing time\n",
    "    process_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time\n",
    "    process_time_ms = round(process_time * 1000, 2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Log the response\n",
    "    print(f\"[{request_id}] <-- {response.status_code} ({process_time_ms}ms)\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Add custom headers to response\n",
    "    response.headers[\"X-Process-Time\"] = f\"{process_time_ms}ms\"\n",
    "    response.headers[\"X-Request-ID\"] = request_id\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return response\n",
    "\n",

    "    return {\"message\": \"This was slow\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`@app.middleware(\"http\")`**: Registers the function as HTTP middleware. It will be called for every request.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`request` parameter**: Contains all information about the incoming request (method, URL, headers, body, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`call_next` function**: This is crucial—it passes the request to the next middleware or the actual endpoint. Without calling this, the request would never reach your endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pre-processing**: Code before `call_next` runs before the endpoint. Use this for request logging, authentication checks, rate limiting, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Post-processing**: Code after `call_next` runs after the endpoint returns. Use this for response modification, logging, cleanup, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Middleware for Request Timing and Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "A common use case is measuring request duration and adding performance headers:\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you've learned to manage requests and application lifecycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Middleware Basics**: Understanding how middleware intercepts requests and responses, using `@app.middleware` decorator for simple middleware, and the flow of request processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Built-in Middleware**: Using `CORSMiddleware` for cross-origin requests, `GZipMiddleware` for compression, `TrustedHostMiddleware` for security, and `HTTPSRedirectMiddleware` for SSL enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Custom Middleware**: Creating reusable middleware classes by inheriting from `BaseHTTPMiddleware`, implementing rate limiting, request ID tracking, and authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lifespan Events**: Using the `lifespan` context manager for startup and shutdown logic, initializing resources like database connections and ML models, and ensuring proper cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Request Logging Middleware**: Create middleware that logs all requests with:\n",
    "   - Timestamp, method, path, status code, processing time\n",
    "   - Request body (for POST/PUT/PATCH)\n",
    "   - Response body (truncated for large responses)\n",
    "   - Write logs to a file in JSON format\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rate Limiter with Redis**: Implement a production-ready rate limiter that:\n",
    "   - Uses Redis for distributed rate limiting\n",
    "   - Supports different limits per endpoint\n",
    "   - Handles authenticated users differently\n",
    "   - Returns proper rate limit headers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Caching Middleware**: Create middleware that:\n",
    "   - Caches GET responses in Redis\n",
    "   - Uses request path + query params as cache key\n",
    "   - Respects Cache-Control headers\n",
    "   - Allows cache invalidation via headers\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Enhance the lifespan handler to:\n",
    "   - Accept SIGTERM and SIGINT signals\n",
    "   - Stop accepting new requests\n",
    "   - Wait for existing requests to complete\n",
    "   - Timeout and force-close after 30 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 11: Security Fundamentals** will cover:\n",
    "- Understanding security schemes in OpenAPI\n",
    "- Implementing HTTP Basic authentication\n",
