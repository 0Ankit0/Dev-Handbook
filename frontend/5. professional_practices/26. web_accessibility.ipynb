    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine trying to use a website with your eyes closed. Or imagine not being able to use a mouse and having to navigate solely with your keyboard. For millions of people with disabilities, this is their daily reality when browsing the web. **Web accessibility** (often abbreviated as **a11y**) ensures that websites and web applications are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or the way they access the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility is not just a nice-to-have feature\u2014it is a fundamental requirement for modern web development. It overlaps strongly with semantic HTML, performance, and good user experience design. When you build accessible websites, you improve the experience for all users, including those with temporary disabilities (like a broken arm), situational limitations (bright sunlight), or older devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why accessibility matters** \u2013 the moral, legal, and business cases.\n",
    "- **The WCAG principles** \u2013 the international standard for web accessibility.\n",
    "- **Semantic HTML for accessibility** \u2013 how to structure content for assistive technologies.\n",
    "- **Keyboard accessibility** \u2013 ensuring all functionality is available without a mouse.\n",
    "- **ARIA** \u2013 when and how to use Accessible Rich Internet Applications.\n",
    "- **Focus management** \u2013 controlling keyboard focus in dynamic applications.\n",
    "- **Testing for accessibility** \u2013 tools and techniques to find and fix issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will have the knowledge to build websites that are inclusive, robust, and compliant with accessibility standards.\n",

    "## 26.1 Why Accessibility Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessibility for All Users\n",
    "\n",
    "Web accessibility is about removing barriers. Consider these scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A person who is blind uses a **screen reader** that reads aloud the content and structure of a page.\n",
    "- A person with limited mobility uses only a **keyboard** (or a switch device) to navigate.\n",
    "- A person who is deaf or hard of hearing relies on **captions** for video content.\n",
    "- A person with color blindness needs sufficient **color contrast** to read text.\n",
    "- An older adult with tremors needs **larger click targets** and forgiving timing.\n",
    "- A user in a rural area with slow internet needs **accessible content** even if images don't load.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you design with accessibility in mind, you serve all these users\u2014and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Legal Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Many countries have laws and regulations mandating web accessibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **United States:** Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n",
    "- **European Union:** European Accessibility Act, Web Accessibility Directive.\n",
    "- **United Kingdom:** Equality Act 2010.\n",
    "- **Canada:** Accessible Canada Act.\n",
    "- **Australia:** Disability Discrimination Act 1992.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure to comply can lead to lawsuits, fines, and reputational damage. Many high\u2011profile companies have faced legal action over inaccessible websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Larger audience** \u2013 an estimated 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability.\n",
    "- **Better SEO** \u2013 many accessibility practices (semantic HTML, alt text, headings) align with search engine optimization.\n",
    "- **Improved usability** \u2013 accessible sites tend to be cleaner, faster, and easier for everyone to use.\n",
    "- **Reduced legal risk** \u2013 proactive accessibility reduces the chance of litigation.\n",
    "- **Positive brand image** \u2013 demonstrating inclusivity builds trust and loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 26.2 WCAG Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** are the international standard for web accessibility, developed by the W3C. WCAG is organized around four core principles, often remembered by the acronym **POUR**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Perceivable** \u2013 Users must be able to perceive the content (it cannot be invisible to all their senses).\n",
    "- **Operable** \u2013 Users must be able to operate the interface (it cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform).\n",
    "- **Understandable** \u2013 Users must be able to understand the information and operation of the interface.\n",
    "- **Robust** \u2013 Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each principle has specific guidelines, and each guideline has testable success criteria at three levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level A** \u2013 The most basic web accessibility features. Your site must meet this level to avoid barriers for some users.\n",
    "- **Level AA** \u2013 Addresses the most common barriers for disabled users. This is the target for most organizations and the standard referenced in many laws.\n",
    "- **Level AAA** \u2013 The highest level of accessibility, which may not be possible for all content.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we focus on meeting at least WCAG 2.1 Level AA.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 26.3 Semantic HTML for Accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic HTML (covered in depth in Chapter 6) is the foundation of web accessibility. Assistive technologies rely on the meaning conveyed by HTML elements to present content to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proper Heading Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Headings (`<h1>` through `<h6>`) create an outline of your document. Screen reader users can navigate by headings, jumping from one section to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!-- Good heading structure -->\n",
    "<h1>Main Page Title</h1>\n",
    "    <h2>Section One</h2>\n",
    "        <h3>Subsection A</h3>\n",
    "        <h3>Subsection B</h3>\n",
    "    <h2>Section Two</h2>\n",
    "        <h3>Subsection C</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Bad heading structure (skipping levels) -->\n",
    "<h1>Main Title</h1>\n",
    "    <h3>Subsection</h3> <!-- skipped h2 -->\n",
    "        <h5>Detail</h5> <!-- skipped h4 -->\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "- One `<h1>` per page (typically the page title).\n",
    "- Don't skip heading levels (e.g., h2 \u2192 h4).\n",
    "- Use headings for structure, not just for bold text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Landmark Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML5 introduced landmark elements that help screen reader users navigate to major regions of a page:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `<header>` \u2013 banner landmark (usually site header)\n",
    "- `<nav>` \u2013 navigation landmark\n",
    "- `<main>` \u2013 main landmark (unique per page)\n",
    "- `<aside>` \u2013 complementary landmark (sidebar)\n",
    "- `<footer>` \u2013 contentinfo landmark (usually site footer)\n",
    "- `<form>` \u2013 form landmark (if it has an accessible name)\n",
    "- `<section>` \u2013 region landmark (if it has an accessible name)\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "    <header>\n",
    "        <h1>My Site</h1>\n",
    "        <nav aria-label=\"Main navigation\">\n",
    "            <ul>\n",
    "                <li><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li>\n",
    "                <li><a href=\"/about\">About</a></li>\n",
    "            </ul>\n",
    "        </nav>\n",
    "    </header>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <main>\n",
    "        <article>\n",
    "            <h2>Article Title</h2>\n",
    "            <p>Content...</p>\n",
    "        </article>\n",
    "    </main>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <aside aria-label=\"Related links\">\n",
    "        <h3>Related Articles</h3>\n",
    "        <ul>\n",
    "            <li><a href=\"/related1\">Article 1</a></li>\n",
    "        </ul>\n",
    "    </aside>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <footer>\n",
    "        <p>&copy; 2024 My Site</p>\n",
    "    </footer>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple landmarks of the same type exist (e.g., two `<nav>` elements), give them distinct accessible names using `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessible Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "Forms must be properly labeled so screen reader users know what each field is for.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!-- Good: explicit label with for attribute -->\n",
    "<label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n",
    "<input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Also good: implicit label (wrapping) -->\n",
    "<label>\n",
    "    Email:\n",
    "    <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\">\n",
    "</label>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- For groups of radios/checkboxes, use fieldset and legend -->\n",
    "<fieldset>\n",
    "    <legend>Choose your preferred contact method:</legend>\n",
    "    <input type=\"radio\" name=\"contact\" id=\"contactEmail\" value=\"email\">\n",
    "    <label for=\"contactEmail\">Email</label>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <input type=\"radio\" name=\"contact\" id=\"contactPhone\" value=\"phone\">\n",
    "    <label for=\"contactPhone\">Phone</label>\n",
    "</fieldset>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Always associate every form control with a label, either explicitly or implicitly. Placeholders are **not** a substitute for labels\u2014they disappear when the user types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessible Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Use table headers (`<th>`) with the `scope` attribute to associate headers with data cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <caption>Monthly savings</caption>\n",
    "    <thead>\n",
    "        <tr>\n",
    "            <th scope=\"col\">Month</th>\n",
    "            <th scope=\"col\">Savings</th>\n",
    "        </tr>\n",
    "    </thead>\n",
    "    <tbody>\n",
    "        <tr>\n",
    "            <th scope=\"row\">January</th>\n",
    "            <td>$100</td>\n",
    "        </tr>\n",
    "        <tr>\n",
    "            <th scope=\"row\">February</th>\n",
    "            <td>$80</td>\n",
    "        </tr>\n",
    "    </tbody>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex tables with multiple levels of headers, use the `headers` attribute to explicitly associate cells with header IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessible Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Every image must have an **alt attribute**. The content of the `alt` text depends on the image's purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Informative images** \u2013 describe the image briefly.\n",
    "- **Decorative images** \u2013 use `alt=\"\"` (empty) so screen readers ignore them.\n",
    "- **Functional images** (like image links) \u2013 describe the link's destination.\n",
    "- **Complex images** (charts, diagrams) \u2013 provide a longer description nearby or in the `alt` text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!-- Informative -->\n",
    "<img src=\"puppy.jpg\" alt=\"A golden retriever puppy playing in grass\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Decorative -->\n",
    "<img src=\"background-flourish.png\" alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Functional (image link) -->\n",
    "<a href=\"/puppies\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"puppy-icon.jpg\" alt=\"View puppies\">\n",
    "</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Complex image -->\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"sales-chart.png\" alt=\"Bar chart showing sales growth by quarter\">\n",
    "    <figcaption>Sales increased by 25% in Q4 2023, with the highest growth in the electronics category.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Never** omit the `alt` attribute\u2014if you do, some screen readers will read the image filename instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 26.4 Keyboard Accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Many users cannot use a mouse and rely on the keyboard to navigate. Your site must be fully operable with only the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tab Order\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural tab order follows the source order of focusable elements (links, buttons, form controls). Ensure that the tab order follows a logical reading order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not** use a positive `tabindex` value (greater than 0) to reorder focus\u2014it's confusing and violates expectations. Stick with the default source order, or use negative `tabindex` to remove elements from the tab order programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Focus Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Every focusable element must have a visible focus indicator. Browsers provide a default outline (usually a blue ring), but you may customize it\u2014just ensure it remains highly visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "/* Custom focus style - must be clearly visible */\n",
    "button:focus,\n",
    "a:focus,\n",
    "input:focus {\n",
    "    outline: 3px solid #4a90e2;\n",
    "    outline-offset: 2px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "/* Never do this */\n",
    ":focus {\n",
    "    outline: none; /* Removes focus indicator - BAD! */\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remove the default outline, you **must** provide an alternative focus style that meets contrast requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skip Links\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip links allow keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation and jump directly to the main content. They are usually hidden until focused.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "    <a href=\"#main-content\" class=\"skip-link\">Skip to main content</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <header>\n",
    "        <nav><!-- long navigation --></nav>\n",
    "    </header>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <main id=\"main-content\">\n",
    "        <h1>Main Content</h1>\n",
    "        <!-- ... -->\n",
    "    </main>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".skip-link {\n",
    "    position: absolute;\n",
    "    left: -9999px;\n",
    "    top: 0;\n",
    "    z-index: 999;\n",
    "    padding: 1em;\n",
    "    background: #000;\n",
    "    color: #fff;\n",
    "    text-decoration: none;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".skip-link:focus {\n",
    "    left: 50%;\n",
    "    transform: translateX(-50%);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyboard Traps\n",
    "\n",
    "A keyboard trap occurs when a user can tab into an element but cannot tab out of it. This is often caused by custom modal dialogs or complex widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Always** ensure that users can move focus out of any element using the keyboard (usually Tab, Shift+Tab, or Esc).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `tabindex` Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tabindex=\"0\"` \u2013 makes an element focusable in the natural tab order (useful for custom interactive elements like `<div role=\"button\">`).\n",
    "- `tabindex=\"-1\"` \u2013 makes an element programmatically focusable (via JavaScript) but removes it from the tab order. Useful for managing focus in dynamic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"doSomething()\">\n",
    "    Custom Button\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Never** use positive `tabindex` values (1, 2, etc.)\u2014they create a confusing tab order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 26.5 ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)\n",
    "\n",
    "ARIA is a set of attributes that enhance accessibility when HTML alone is insufficient. It provides additional semantics to custom components, live regions, and complex widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use ARIA\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first rule of ARIA:** If you can use a native HTML element with the semantics you need, do so. Native elements have built\u2011in keyboard support and accessibility features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use ARIA:**\n",
    "- Creating custom widgets (e.g., a tab panel, slider, or modal dialog) that don't have native HTML equivalents.\n",
    "- Providing additional context (e.g., indicating that a region is live\u2011updating).\n",
    "- Fixing accessibility issues when you cannot change the HTML (e.g., legacy code).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ARIA Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles define what an element is or does. Some common roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `role=\"button\"` \u2013 makes an element behave like a button.\n",
    "- `role=\"navigation\"` \u2013 identifies a navigation region (though `<nav>` is preferred).\n",
    "- `role=\"main\"` \u2013 identifies the main content (though `<main>` is preferred).\n",
    "- `role=\"complementary\"` \u2013 for sidebars (though `<aside>` is preferred).\n",
    "- `role=\"alert\"` \u2013 for important, time\u2011sensitive messages.\n",
    "- `role=\"dialog\"` \u2013 for modal dialogs.\n",
    "- `role=\"tablist\"`, `role=\"tab\"`, `role=\"tabpanel\"` \u2013 for tab interfaces.\n",
    "\n",

    "### ARIA States and Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "ARIA provides attributes that describe the current state of a widget:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `aria-expanded=\"true|false\"` \u2013 indicates whether a collapsible section is expanded.\n",
    "- `aria-checked=\"true|false\"` \u2013 for custom checkboxes.\n",
    "- `aria-selected=\"true|false\"` \u2013 for tab or grid selections.\n",
    "- `aria-hidden=\"true\"` \u2013 hides an element from assistive technologies (use carefully).\n",
    "- `aria-label=\"description\"` \u2013 provides an accessible name when no visible label exists.\n",
    "- `aria-labelledby=\"id1 id2\"` \u2013 references IDs of elements that label this one.\n",
    "- `aria-describedby=\"id\"` \u2013 references an element that provides a longer description.\n",
    "- `aria-live=\"polite|assertive\"` \u2013 announces dynamic updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!-- Custom checkbox -->\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Live Regions\n",
    "\n",
    "`aria-live` regions tell screen readers to announce changes to content without moving focus. Useful for chat messages, error summaries, or status updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `aria-live=\"polite\"` \u2013 announces changes when the user is idle.\n",
    "- `aria-live=\"assertive\"` \u2013 announces immediately, interrupting other speech.\n",

    "## 26.6 Focus Management\n",
    "\n",
    "In dynamic web applications, you must manage focus to ensure keyboard users know where they are and where they've landed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programmatic Focus\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `.focus()` method to move focus to an element. This is essential when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opening a modal dialog (focus should move into the dialog).\n",
    "- Closing a modal (focus should return to the element that opened it).\n",

    "## 26.7 Testing for Accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is crucial to ensure your site is truly accessible. Use a combination of automated tools, manual checks, and assistive technology testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automated Testing Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated tools can catch many common issues, but they cannot detect everything (e.g., whether `alt` text is actually descriptive).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **WAVE** (browser extension) \u2013 visualizes accessibility issues on your page.\n",
    "- **axe DevTools** (browser extension) \u2013 powerful rule\u2011based testing.\n",
    "- **Lighthouse** (built into Chrome DevTools) \u2013 includes accessibility audits.\n",
    "- **Accessibility Insights** (Microsoft) \u2013 guided testing for various platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Using axe in CI/CD\n",
    "npx axe https://example.com --save report.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated tools miss about 30\u201150% of accessibility issues. Manual testing is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keyboard testing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unplug your mouse.\n",
    "2. Navigate the entire site using only Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, and arrow keys.\n",
    "3. Ensure you can:\n",
    "   - Access all interactive elements.\n",
    "   - See a clear focus indicator at all times.\n",
    "   - Operate all functionality (dropdowns, modals, sliders).\n",
    "   - Never get trapped in an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zoom testing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Zoom the page to 200% (Ctrl/Cmd + +).\n",
    "2. Ensure no content is cut off or overlaps, and that all functionality remains usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Color contrast testing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a color contrast checker (e.g., WebAIM Contrast Checker) to ensure text meets WCAG requirements:\n",
    "- Normal text: contrast ratio \u2265 4.5:1 (AA) or 7:1 (AAA)\n",
    "- Large text (\u226518pt or 14pt bold): \u2265 3:1 (AA) or 4.5:1 (AAA)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Screen Reader Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing with actual screen readers is the most accurate way to understand the experience of blind users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NVDA** (Windows, free)\n",
    "- **JAWS** (Windows, paid)\n",
    "- **VoiceOver** (macOS, built\u2011in)\n",
    "- **TalkBack** (Android)\n",
    "- **VoiceOver** (iOS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic screen reader testing workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Turn on the screen reader.\n",
    "2. Navigate using keyboard shortcuts (e.g., arrow keys to read line by line, heading navigation, form navigation).\n",
    "3. Listen to how content is announced.\n",
    "4. Verify that:\n",
    "   - All content is read in a logical order.\n",
    "   - Images have appropriate `alt` text.\n",
    "   - Form inputs have labels.\n",
    "   - Dynamic updates are announced (live regions).\n",
    "   - Custom widgets have correct roles and states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Accessibility Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "| Issue | How to Detect | How to Fix |\n",
    "|-------|---------------|------------|\n",
    "| Missing alt text | Automated tools | Add `alt` attribute; empty for decorative |\n",
    "| Low color contrast | Automated tools, visual inspection | Adjust colors to meet contrast ratios |\n",
    "| No focus indicator | Keyboard testing | Add visible `:focus` styles |\n",
    "| Empty links/buttons | Automated tools | Add text or `aria-label` |\n",
    "| Missing form labels | Automated tools | Add `<label>` elements |\n",
    "| Heading hierarchy broken | Manual inspection, heading navigation | Restructure headings logically |\n",
    "| Inaccessible custom widget | Screen reader testing | Add proper ARIA roles and keyboard support |\n",
    "| Missing skip link | Keyboard testing | Add \"Skip to main content\" link |\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned the principles and practices of web accessibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why accessibility matters** \u2013 for users, legal compliance, and business success.\n",
    "- **WCAG POUR principles** \u2013 Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust.\n",
    "- **Semantic HTML** \u2013 headings, landmarks, forms, tables, and images as the foundation.\n",
    "- **Keyboard accessibility** \u2013 tab order, focus indicators, skip links, and avoiding traps.\n",
    "- **ARIA** \u2013 using roles, states, and properties when HTML is insufficient, and following the first rule of ARIA.\n",
    "- **Focus management** \u2013 programmatically moving focus in dynamic applications, especially modals.\n",
    "- **Testing** \u2013 using automated tools, manual checks, and screen readers to find and fix issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accessibility is not optional\u2014it's a fundamental requirement of professional web development.\n",
    "- Start with semantic HTML; it solves most accessibility problems out of the box.\n",
    "- Ensure full keyboard operability with visible focus indicators.\n",
    "- Use ARIA only when necessary, and always test with assistive technology.\n",
    "- Test early and often\u2014automated tools are helpful but cannot replace manual testing.\n",
    "- Accessibility benefits everyone, not just users with disabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take a simple webpage (e.g., a blog post) and audit it using the WAVE browser extension. Fix all errors and warnings, then re\u2011audit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Build a custom modal dialog from scratch (not using the `<dialog>` element). Ensure it has proper ARIA roles, keyboard focus trapping, and returns focus when closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a form with various input types. Use a screen reader to fill it out. Add any missing labels or ARIA attributes needed to make it fully accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement a \"Skip to main content\" link on a page with a long navigation menu. Test it with keyboard navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a custom checkbox component using `<div>` and ARIA. Ensure it works with keyboard (Space to toggle) and has proper `aria-checked` states.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use the Accessibility Insights tool to run a full assessment on a site you've built. Address all issues found.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Test your site at 200% zoom and with high contrast mode enabled (if available on your OS). Identify and fix any layout or visibility issues.\n",
