    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you\u2019re at a restaurant. You place your order, and then you wait\u2014doing nothing\u2014until your food arrives. That\u2019s **synchronous** behavior: one task at a time, blocking everything else. Now imagine you order, then chat with friends while the kitchen prepares your meal. When the food is ready, the waiter brings it to you. That\u2019s **asynchronous** behavior: you initiated a task and then moved on to other things, and you were notified when the task completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, many operations are asynchronous by nature:\n",
    "- Fetching data from a server (AJAX)\n",
    "- Reading/writing files (in Node.js)\n",
    "- Timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)\n",
    "- User events (clicks, keypresses)\n",
    "\n",
    "If JavaScript were purely synchronous, your entire web page would freeze every time it waited for a network response. Fortunately, JavaScript has a powerful asynchronous model built around the **event loop**, **callbacks**, **promises**, and **async/await**. Mastering these concepts is essential for creating responsive, modern web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The difference between synchronous and asynchronous code.\n",
    "- How the JavaScript event loop enables concurrency.\n",
    "- How to work with callbacks, promises, and async/await.\n",
    "- How to make HTTP requests using the Fetch API.\n",
    "- How to handle JSON data.\n",
    "- Practical patterns like infinite scroll and autocomplete.\n",

    "## 23.1 Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Synchronous Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In synchronous code, each statement executes one after the other, and the next statement cannot start until the previous one finishes. This is the default behavior for most JavaScript code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "console.log('First');\n",
    "console.log('Second');\n",
    "console.log('Third');\n",
    "// Output: First, Second, Third\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is straightforward, but if one operation takes a long time (e.g., a large loop or a network request), it **blocks** the entire thread. In a browser, that means the page becomes unresponsive\u2014no scrolling, no clicking\u2014until the operation completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Asynchronous Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous code allows the program to start a long\u2011running task and then continue with other work. When the task completes, the program is notified and can handle the result. This non\u2011blocking behavior keeps the UI responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "console.log('Start');\n",
    "\n",
    "setTimeout(() => {\n",
    "    console.log('Timeout finished');\n",
    "}, 2000);\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log('End');\n",
    "// Output: Start, End, (after 2 seconds) Timeout finished\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though `setTimeout` takes two seconds, the `console.log('End')` runs immediately. The callback inside `setTimeout` is executed later, without blocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The JavaScript Event Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is single\u2011threaded, meaning it has only one call stack and one heap. So how does it handle asynchronous operations? The secret is the **event loop**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Call Stack**: Where functions are pushed when they are called, and popped when they return.\n",
    "- **Web APIs**: Browser\u2011provided APIs (DOM events, `setTimeout`, `fetch`, etc.) that handle asynchronous tasks.\n",
    "- **Callback Queue** (or Task Queue): Where callbacks from completed asynchronous tasks wait to be executed.\n",
    "- **Event Loop**: Constantly checks if the call stack is empty; if it is, it takes the first callback from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual representation:**\n",

    "\n",
    "## 23.2 Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Callback?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **callback** is a function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later when an asynchronous operation completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function fetchData(callback) {\n",
    "    setTimeout(() => {\n",
    "        const data = { id: 1, name: 'Alice' };\n",
    "        callback(data);\n",
    "    }, 1000);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fetchData((result) => {\n",
    "    console.log('Data received:', result);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asynchronous Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Web APIs use callbacks:\n",
    "- `setTimeout(callback, delay)`\n",
    "- `addEventListener('click', callback)`\n",
    "- `fs.readFile(path, callback)` in Node.js\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callback Hell\n",
    "\n",
    "When you nest multiple asynchronous callbacks, the code becomes deeply indented and hard to read\u2014a situation known as **callback hell** or the **pyramid of doom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "getUser(1, (user) => {\n",
    "    getPosts(user.id, (posts) => {\n",
    "        getComments(posts[0].id, (comments) => {\n",
    "            displayComments(comments);\n",
    "        });\n",
    "    });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is difficult to maintain, error\u2011prone, and makes error handling messy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling with Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "A common pattern in Node.js callbacks is **error\u2011first** callbacks: the first argument of the callback is an error object (or `null` if no error).\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function readFile(path, callback) {\n",
    "    // simulate async read\n",
    "    setTimeout(() => {\n",
    "        if (path === 'bad.txt') {\n",
    "            callback(new Error('File not found'));\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            callback(null, 'file contents');\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }, 1000);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "readFile('good.txt', (err, data) => {\n",
    "    if (err) {\n",
    "        console.error('Error:', err);\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        console.log('Data:', data);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its usefulness, error handling in deeply nested callbacks becomes repetitive and chaotic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.3 Promises\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Promise** is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. Promises provide a cleaner, more robust way to handle async code compared to callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Promise States\n",
    "\n",
    "A promise can be in one of three states:\n",
    "- **pending**: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.\n",
    "- **fulfilled**: the operation completed successfully.\n",
    "- **rejected**: the operation failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it is **settled** and cannot change state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Promise\n",
    "\n",
    "You create a promise using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a function (called the executor) with two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n",
    "    // async operation\n",
    "    setTimeout(() => {\n",
    "        const success = true;\n",
    "        if (success) {\n",
    "            resolve('Operation succeeded');\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            reject(new Error('Operation failed'));\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }, 1000);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Promises: `then`, `catch`, `finally`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `then(onFulfilled, onRejected)` \u2013 attaches callbacks for fulfillment and rejection.\n",
    "- `catch(onRejected)` \u2013 attaches a callback for rejection only.\n",
    "- `finally(onFinally)` \u2013 executes a callback when the promise is settled (fulfilled or rejected).\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "promise\n",
    "    .then((result) => {\n",
    "        console.log('Success:', result);\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    .catch((error) => {\n",
    "        console.error('Error:', error);\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    .finally(() => {\n",
    "        console.log('Promise settled');\n",
    "    });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Promise Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of promises is **chaining**. Each `then` returns a new promise, allowing you to sequence asynchronous operations linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "getUser(1)\n",
    "    .then((user) => getPosts(user.id))\n",
    "    .then((posts) => getComments(posts[0].id))\n",
    "    .then((comments) => displayComments(comments))\n",
    "    .catch((error) => console.error('Error:', error));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If any promise in the chain rejects, the chain skips to the nearest `catch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling with Promises\n",
    "\n",
    "You can handle errors at the end of the chain, or even inside `then` by providing a second callback. However, it's generally cleaner to use `catch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "getUser(1)\n",
    "    .then((user) => getPosts(user.id))\n",
    "    .then((posts) => {\n",
    "        // handle posts, but may throw\n",
    "        if (!posts.length) throw new Error('No posts');\n",
    "        return getComments(posts[0].id);\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    .catch((error) => {\n",
    "        console.error('Caught:', error);\n",
    "        // You can also return a default value to continue the chain\n",
    "        return [];\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    .then((comments) => {\n",
    "        // this runs even after catch\n",
    "        console.log('Comments:', comments);\n",

    "## 23.5 Async/Await\n",
    "\n",
    "Async/await is syntactic sugar built on top of promises. It makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, improving readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `async` Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Declaring a function with the `async` keyword automatically makes it return a promise. Any value returned from the function is wrapped in a resolved promise; any thrown error is wrapped in a rejected promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function greet() {\n",
    "    return 'Hello';\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "greet().then(console.log); // 'Hello'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `await` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "`await` can only be used inside an `async` function. It pauses the execution of the function until the promise settles, and then returns the fulfilled value (or throws if rejected).\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function getUserData(id) {\n",
    "    try {\n",
    "        const response = await fetch(`/users/${id}`);\n",
    "        if (!response.ok) {\n",
    "            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        const user = await response.json();\n",
    "        console.log('User:', user);\n",
    "        return user;\n",
    "    } catch (error) {\n",
    "        console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);\n",
    "        throw error; // re-throw if needed\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling with `try...catch`\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `try...catch` with async/await is much more natural than `.catch()` chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function process() {\n",
    "    try {\n",
    "        const user = await getUser(1);\n",

    "        console.error('Something went wrong:', error);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel Async Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have multiple independent async operations, you can run them in parallel using `Promise.all` (or `Promise.allSettled`) with `await`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function fetchAllUsers() {\n",
    "    const userPromises = [1, 2, 3].map(id => fetch(`/users/${id}`).then(res => res.json()));\n",
    "    const users = await Promise.all(userPromises);\n",
    "    console.log(users);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "Be careful not to accidentally serialize parallel operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// \u274c Sequential - takes total time = sum of each\n",

    "- `response.text()` \u2013 returns as plain text.\n",
    "- `response.blob()` \u2013 for binary data (images, files).\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned the fundamentals of asynchronous JavaScript, which is essential for building responsive web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synchronous vs Asynchronous**: Synchronous code blocks; asynchronous code allows other operations while waiting.\n",
    "- **Event Loop**: The mechanism that enables concurrency in JavaScript.\n",
    "- **Callbacks**: The original pattern for async code, leading to callback hell.\n",
    "- **Promises**: Provide a cleaner way to handle async operations with `.then()` and `.catch()`.\n",
    "- **Promise Methods**: `Promise.all`, `Promise.allSettled`, `Promise.race`, `Promise.any` for managing multiple promises.\n",
    "- **Async/Await**: Syntactic sugar over promises that makes async code look synchronous.\n",
    "- **Fetch API**: Modern, promise\u2011based way to make HTTP requests.\n",
    "- **JSON**: The standard data format for web APIs.\n",
    "- **Practical Examples**: Dynamic content loading, autocomplete, infinite scroll, and form submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Async code prevents the UI from freezing.\n",
    "- Promises and async/await greatly improve readability and error handling over raw callbacks.\n",
    "- Always handle errors in async operations\u2014either with `.catch()` or `try/catch`.\n",
    "- Use `Promise.all` for parallel independent tasks, but be mindful of error propagation.\n",
    "- `fetch()` does not reject on HTTP errors; check `response.ok`.\n",
    "- Debounce user input to avoid excessive network requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rewrite the callback\u2011based example from section 23.2 (getUser \u2192 getPosts \u2192 getComments) using promises, and then using async/await.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a function `fetchWithTimeout(url, timeout)` that returns a promise that rejects if the fetch takes longer than `timeout` milliseconds. Use `Promise.race`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Build a simple image gallery that loads images from an API when the page scrolls near the bottom (infinite scroll). Use the Unsplash or any free image API.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement a typeahead/autocomplete input that fetches suggestions from a public API (e.g., countries, cities) and displays them. Add debouncing and keyboard navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use `Promise.allSettled` to fetch data from multiple endpoints (e.g., `/users`, `/posts`, `/comments`) and display a message indicating which succeeded and which failed.\n",
