The resources are organized into categories:

- **Documentation and Specifications** – Official sources for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Learning Platforms and Tutorials** – Interactive courses and written guides.
- **Reference and Cheat Sheets** – Quick lookup resources.
- **Tools and Utilities** – Code editors, validators, optimizers, and more.
- **Blogs and Newsletters** – Stay current with industry trends.
- **Communities and Forums** – Places to ask questions and connect with other developers.
- **Accessibility Resources** – Tools and guidelines for inclusive design.
- **Performance Resources** – Learn and measure web performance.
