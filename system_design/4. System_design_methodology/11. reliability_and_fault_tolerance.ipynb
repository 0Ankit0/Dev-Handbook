    "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify different types of failures in distributed systems\n",
    "- Design systems with appropriate redundancy strategies\n",
    "- Implement robust retry mechanisms with backoff and jitter\n",
    "- Apply the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures\n",
    "- Use bulkhead patterns to isolate failures\n",
    "- Understand and apply chaos engineering principles\n",
    "- Design comprehensive disaster recovery plans with clear RPO and RTO\n",
    "- Build systems that gracefully degrade under failure\n",

    "## **Introduction: Why Reliability Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building a system for a hospital. A patient's life depends on accessing their medical records. The database crashes. What happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "In an unreliable system:\n",
    "- Doctors can't access patient history\n",
    "- Critical medications might be missed\n",
    "- Lives could be at risk\n",
    "\n",
    "In a reliable system:\n",
    "- The database fails, but a replica takes over in milliseconds\n",
    "- Doctors see a brief delay, then continue working\n",
    "- No data is lost, no patient impact\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reliability** is not a \"nice-to-have\"—it's the foundation of production systems. Unreliable systems lose users, revenue, and trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Reliability?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability is the probability that a system will perform its intended function without failure over a specified period of time under specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key attributes of reliable systems:**\n",
    "- **Fault Tolerance**: The ability to continue operating despite component failures\n",
    "- **Resilience**: The ability to recover quickly from failures\n",
    "- **Graceful Degradation**: The ability to provide reduced functionality when parts fail\n",
    "- **High Availability**: The system is accessible when needed\n",
    "\n",

    "**Definition**: A component stops operating completely and ceases to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Process crashes due to unhandled exception\n",
    "- Server hardware failure (CPU, RAM, disk)\n",
    "- Operating system kernel panic\n",
    "- Database service stops\n",
    "- Application exceeds memory limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Clean and detectable (component is either alive or dead)\n",
    "- Often caused by software bugs, resource exhaustion, or hardware issues\n",
    "- Can be transient (restart fixes it) or permanent (hardware needs replacement)\n",

    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "System: E-commerce checkout service\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure: Checkout process crashes when processing\n",
    "         orders with >100 items\n",

    "Root cause: Integer overflow in item count calculation\n",

    "Detection: Health check fails, process exits\n",

    "### **3. Byzantine Failures**\n",

    "**Definition**: A component behaves arbitrarily or maliciously, not following the protocol.\n",

    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Compromised security (attacker controls a node)\n",
    "- Software bugs causing incorrect behavior\n",
    "- Hardware malfunction producing corrupted data\n",
    "- Clock drift causing timestamp issues\n",
    "- Rogue administrators modifying data\n",

    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- The hardest failure to handle (requires consensus protocols)\n",
    "- Node may return wrong results or send conflicting messages\n",
    "- Can lead to split-brain or data corruption\n",
    "- Requires cryptographic signatures and voting mechanisms\n",

    "Impact:\n",

    "  - Data inconsistency\n",
    "  - Potential financial loss\n",

    "### **The Bulkhead Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Origin**: Ship design\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traditional Ship:\n",
    "  Hull compromised → Water floods entire ship → Ship sinks\n",
    "\n",
    "Ship with Bulkheads:\n",
    "  Hull compromised → Water confined to one compartment → \n",
    "                    Ship stays afloat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Software Systems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Without Bulkheads:\n",
    "  Resource exhaustion in one component → \n",
    "    Entire system affected → \n",
    "      Complete outage\n",
    "\n",
    "With Bulkheads:\n",
    "  Resource exhaustion in one component → \n",
    "    Confined to that component → \n",
    "    Rest of system continues operating\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Bulkhead Pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Isolate resources so that a failure in one part doesn't cascade to the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Bulkheads:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description | Example |\n",
    "|------|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| **Thread Pool Bulkhead** | Separate thread pools per service | Payment service has 10 threads, Notification service has 5 threads |\n",
    "| **Connection Pool Bulkhead** | Separate DB connections per tenant | Tenant A has 20 connections, Tenant B has 20 connections |\n",
    "| **Memory Bulkhead** | Limit memory per component | API server limited to 512MB, Analytics to 1GB |\n",
    "| **Queue Bulkhead** | Separate queues per workload | High-priority queue, Low-priority queue |\n",

    "| **Failure Modes** | Systems fail in three ways: crashes (stop responding), network partitions (can't communicate), and Byzantine failures (arbitrary/malicious behavior) |\n",
    "| **Redundancy** | Active-passive: one active, standby takes over; Active-active: all instances serve traffic, no failover needed |\n",
    "| **Retry Strategies** | Exponential backoff increases delay between retries; Jitter adds randomness to prevent thundering herd; Circuit breaker stops calling failing services |\n",
    "| **Bulkheads** | Isolate resources so one failing component doesn't cascade to the entire system |\n",
    "| **Chaos Engineering** | Proactively break systems to build resilience; define steady state, hypothesize, introduce failures, verify |\n",
