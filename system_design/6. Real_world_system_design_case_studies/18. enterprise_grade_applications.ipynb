    "# **Chapter 18: Enterprise-Grade Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprise systems operate at massive scale while maintaining strict correctness guarantees. Unlike consumer apps where occasional inconsistency is acceptable, financial systems, inventory management, and coordination services must be bulletproof. This chapter covers the architecture behind the world's most critical infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **18.1 Design a Distributed Message Queue (Kafka-style)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Kafka revolutionized event streaming by treating messages as immutable logs rather than transient queue items. It's the backbone of real-time analytics, event sourcing, and microservice communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Scope (Requirements)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional Requirements**:\n",
    "1. **Publish/Subscribe**: Producers send messages; consumers read them\n",
    "2. **Topics**: Logical channels for message categories\n",
    "3. **Partitions**: Parallel processing within a topic\n",
    "4. **Persistence**: Messages retained for configurable time (days/weeks)\n",
    "5. **Consumer Groups**: Multiple consumers coordinate to process messages without duplication\n",
    "6. **Replay**: Ability to re-read messages from beginning or specific offset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Functional Requirements**:\n",
    "1. **Throughput**: 1 million messages/second per cluster\n",
    "2. **Latency**: P99 < 10ms for publish, < 100ms for consume\n",
    "3. **Durability**: Zero message loss once acknowledged\n",
    "4. **Availability**: 99.95% uptime\n",
    "5. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling by adding brokers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Challenge**: Maintaining order within partitions while allowing parallel consumption across partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Sketch (Back-of-the-Envelope)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traffic**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1M messages/sec\n",
    "Average message size: 1KB\n",
    "Throughput: 1 GB/sec incoming\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication factor: 3\n",
    "Network traffic: 3 GB/sec (write to 3 brokers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage:\n",
    "1M msg/sec \u00d7 1KB \u00d7 86400 sec/day = 86 TB/day\n",
    "Retention: 7 days = 602 TB per cluster\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partition Math**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "To consume 1M msg/sec with 10 consumers:\n",
    "Need 10 partitions minimum (100K msg/sec per consumer)\n",
    "\n",
    "For 100 consumers: 100 partitions\n",
    "Each partition is a log file on disk\n",

    "Format: [Offset: 8 bytes][Message Size: 4 bytes][Message Data: N bytes]\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable append-only log:\n",
    "Offset 0: {order_id: 100, amount: 50.00}\n",
    "Offset 1: {order_id: 101, amount: 75.00}\n",
    "Offset 2: {order_id: 102, amount: 120.00}\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Index File** (for O(log n) lookups):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sparse index: Every 4096 bytes, record offset \u2192 file position\n",
    "Offset 0 \u2192 Position 0\n",
    "Offset 100 \u2192 Position 4096\n",
    "Offset 200 \u2192 Position 8192\n",
    "\n",
    "To find offset 150:\n",
    "    Binary search index: offset 150 is between 100 and 200\n",

    "Enterprise systems differ from consumer apps in three key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correctness over Speed**: Payment systems sacrifice latency for ACID guarantees. A slow correct answer is better than a fast wrong one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compliance as Architecture**: PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOX aren't checkboxes\u2014they dictate data flow, encryption, and audit trails.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Failure is Normal**: Distributed systems components fail constantly. Design for graceful degradation (circuit breakers, bulkheads, retries).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Saga Pattern** emerged as the solution for distributed transactions, trading atomic isolation for availability and partition tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consensus algorithms** (Raft, Paxos) provide the foundation for coordination, but at the cost of write throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event sourcing** (storing events rather than state) enables audit trails, temporal queries, and system evolution\u2014essential for financial and compliance-heavy domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Payment System**: How would you handle currency conversion fluctuations between authorization (hold) and capture (charge)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Message Queue**: Design a \"dead letter queue\" strategy for messages that fail processing after 3 retries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Distributed Lock**: Implement a \"read-write lock\" using ZooKeeper primitives (multiple readers, exclusive writer).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **E-commerce**: Design a \"flash sale\" system where 100,000 users try to buy 1,000 items simultaneously without overselling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Game Backend**: How would you prevent \"lag switching\" (players intentionally delaying packets to gain advantage)?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Document Editor**: Implement the \"undo\" feature in an OT-based system where other users may have edited the same text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The next chapter will cover **Production Readiness**\u2014observability, monitoring, performance optimization, and deployment strategies that separate prototype systems from production-grade infrastructure."
