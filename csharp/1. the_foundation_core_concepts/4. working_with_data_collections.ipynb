    "# Chapter 4: Working with Data \u2013 Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters, you learned how to store individual pieces of data using variables of various types. But what happens when you need to work with a group of related items? For example, a list of student names, a set of temperatures recorded throughout the day, or a mapping of product IDs to prices. Storing each item in separate variables would be impractical and error\u2011prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **collections** come in. Collections are data structures designed to hold multiple elements, allowing you to add, remove, find, and iterate over them efficiently. In this chapter, you\u2019ll explore the most important collection types in C#:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arrays** \u2013 the simplest collection, with a fixed size.\n",
    "- **Generic collections** like `List<T>` and `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` \u2013 flexible, type\u2011safe, and dynamically resizable.\n",
    "- An introduction to **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)** \u2013 a powerful set of methods that lets you query collections in a declarative way.\n",
    "- The `IEnumerable` interface \u2013 the foundation that enables `foreach` loops and LINQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you\u2019ll be able to store, manage, and query groups of data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 Arrays \u2013 The Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "An **array** is a fixed\u2011size, ordered collection of elements, all of the same type. Arrays are fundamental and appear in almost every language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring and Initializing Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "You declare an array by placing square brackets after the element type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[] numbers;               // declaration \u2013 no memory allocated yet\n",
    "numbers = new int[5];        // initialization \u2013 creates an array of 5 integers, all default (0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine declaration and initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[] numbers = new int[5];       // all elements are 0\n",
    "string[] names = new string[3];   // all elements are null (strings are reference types)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also initialize an array with values using an array initializer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[] primes = new int[] { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 };\n",
    "// or even shorter:\n",
    "int[] primes = { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 };\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler infers the array type from the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Array Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements are accessed by a zero\u2011based index using square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(numbers[0]);   // 10\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(numbers[2]);   // 30\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers[1] = 99;                  // change the second element\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(numbers[1]);   // 99\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to access an index outside the valid range (e.g., `numbers[5]` in a 5\u2011element array), you'll get an `IndexOutOfRangeException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array Length\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Length` property tells you how many elements the array holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30 };\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(numbers[i]);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating Over Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "You already know the `for` loop. But arrays also work perfectly with `foreach`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30 };\n",
    "foreach (int num in numbers)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(num);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`foreach` is often more readable and eliminates off\u2011by\u2011one errors. However, you cannot modify the array elements inside a `foreach` loop (the iteration variable is read\u2011only). For modification, use a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi\u2011Dimensional Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "C# supports two kinds of multi\u2011dimensional arrays: **rectangular** and **jagged**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rectangular Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "A rectangular array has multiple dimensions, and each dimension has a fixed length. They are declared using commas inside the square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// 2\u2011dimensional array (matrix) with 3 rows and 4 columns\n",
    "int[,] matrix = new int[3, 4];\n",
    "\n",
    "// Initialize with values\n",
    "int[,] matrix2 = {\n",
    "    { 1, 2, 3, 4 },\n",
    "    { 5, 6, 7, 8 },\n",
    "    { 9, 10, 11, 12 }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "// Access elements\n",
    "int value = matrix2[1, 2]; // row 1, column 2 -> 7\n",
    "matrix2[0, 0] = 99;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GetLength(dimension)` method returns the length of a specific dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < matrix2.GetLength(0); i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    for (int j = 0; j < matrix2.GetLength(1); j++)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.Write($\"{matrix2[i, j]} \");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jagged Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "A jagged array is an array of arrays. Each sub\u2011array can have a different length. They are declared with multiple square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[][] jagged = new int[3][]; // 3 rows, but columns are not yet defined\n",
    "\n",
    "jagged[0] = new int[] { 1, 2 };\n",
    "jagged[1] = new int[] { 3, 4, 5 };\n",
    "jagged[2] = new int[] { 6 };\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(jagged[1][2]); // 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Jagged arrays are more flexible but slightly more complex to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful Array Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Array` class provides static methods for common operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[] numbers = { 5, 2, 8, 1, 9 };\n",
    "Array.Sort(numbers);          // sorts in place: { 1, 2, 5, 8, 9 }\n",
    "Array.Reverse(numbers);        // reverses: { 9, 8, 5, 2, 1 }\n",
    "int index = Array.IndexOf(numbers, 5); // finds index of 5 -> 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use arrays:** Arrays are best when you have a fixed number of elements and you need maximum performance or interoperability with other languages. For most everyday scenarios, the more flexible collections described next are preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 The `foreach` Loop Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen `foreach` in action. Now let's understand why it works with arrays and other collections. The `foreach` loop is syntactic sugar over the **enumerator pattern**. Any type that implements the `IEnumerable` interface (or its generic counterpart `IEnumerable<T>`) can be used in a `foreach` loop. The compiler translates:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "foreach (int num in numbers)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(num);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "into something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "IEnumerator<int> enumerator = numbers.GetEnumerator();\n",
    "try\n",
    "{\n",
    "    while (enumerator.MoveNext())\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        int num = enumerator.Current;\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(num);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "finally\n",
    "{\n",
    "    enumerator.Dispose();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point: `foreach` works with any collection that exposes a `GetEnumerator` method. All the collections we'll discuss (arrays, `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`) support this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** You cannot modify the collection (add, remove, replace elements) inside a `foreach` loop. Doing so will invalidate the enumerator and throw an `InvalidOperationException`. If you need to modify while iterating, use a `for` loop or iterate over a copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3 Generic Collections: `List<T>` and `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `System.Collections.Generic` namespace contains a wealth of collection classes that are **type\u2011safe** and **dynamic**. Unlike arrays, they grow and shrink as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `List<T>` \u2013 The Dynamic Array\n",
    "\n",
    "`List<T>` is the most commonly used collection. It behaves like an array but can resize automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating and Adding Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System.Collections.Generic; // typically already available\n",
    "\n",
    "List<string> names = new List<string>();\n",
    "names.Add(\"Alice\");\n",
    "names.Add(\"Bob\");\n",
    "names.Add(\"Charlie\");\n",
    "\n",
    "// You can also initialize with a collection initializer\n",
    "List<int> scores = new List<int> { 95, 87, 100, 72 };\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access elements by index, just like an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string firstName = names[0]; // \"Alice\"\n",
    "names[1] = \"Robert\";          // change \"Bob\" to \"Robert\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Count` property gives the number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Console.WriteLine($\"There are {names.Count} names.\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inserting and Removing\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "List<string> names = new List<string> { \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\" };\n",
    "\n",
    "names.Insert(1, \"David\");     // inserts \"David\" at index 1\n",
    "names.Remove(\"Bob\");           // removes the first occurrence of \"Bob\"\n",
    "names.RemoveAt(0);             // removes element at index 0\n",
    "names.Clear();                  // removes all elements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Searching\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "bool hasAlice = names.Contains(\"Alice\");\n",
    "int index = names.IndexOf(\"Charlie\"); // returns -1 if not found\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterating\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `for` or `foreach`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "foreach (string name in names)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(name);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < names.Count; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(names[i]);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Capacity and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "`List<T>` internally uses an array to store elements. When you add an element and the internal array is full, the list allocates a new, larger array (typically doubling the capacity) and copies the elements over. This is efficient for most scenarios, but if you know the final size in advance, you can set the capacity to avoid resizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "List<int> numbers = new List<int>(100); // initial capacity of 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also trim excess capacity with `numbers.TrimExcess()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` \u2013 Key\u2011Value Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary stores a collection of **key\u2011value pairs**, where each key is unique and used to look up the associated value. This is ideal for scenarios like looking up a product by its ID, or counting word frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating and Adding\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Dictionary<string, int> ages = new Dictionary<string, int>();\n",
    "ages.Add(\"Alice\", 30);\n",
    "ages.Add(\"Bob\", 25);\n",
    "ages[\"Charlie\"] = 35; // using indexer also adds if key doesn't exist\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a collection initializer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Dictionary<string, int> ages = new Dictionary<string, int>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    { \"Alice\", 30 },\n",
    "    { \"Bob\", 25 },\n",
    "    { \"Charlie\", 35 }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the indexer with the key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int aliceAge = ages[\"Alice\"]; // 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the key doesn't exist, the indexer throws a `KeyNotFoundException`. To safely attempt retrieval, use `TryGetValue`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "if (ages.TryGetValue(\"David\", out int age))\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine($\"David is {age} years old.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"David not found.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking for a Key\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "bool hasAlice = ages.ContainsKey(\"Alice\");\n",
    "bool hasAge30 = ages.ContainsValue(30); // slower, checks all values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterating Over a Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "You can iterate over the keys, the values, or the key\u2011value pairs (as `KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "foreach (KeyValuePair<string, int> pair in ages)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine($\"{pair.Key} is {pair.Value} years old.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Or use var for brevity\n",
    "foreach (var pair in ages)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine($\"{pair.Key} is {pair.Value} years old.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Just keys\n",
    "foreach (string name in ages.Keys)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(name);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Just values\n",
    "foreach (int age in ages.Values)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(age);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Removing\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "ages.Remove(\"Bob\"); // removes the entry with key \"Bob\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Useful Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HashSet<T>` \u2013 an unordered collection of unique elements. Fast for membership tests.\n",
    "- `Queue<T>` \u2013 first\u2011in, first\u2011out (FIFO) collection.\n",
    "- `Stack<T>` \u2013 last\u2011in, first\u2011out (LIFO) collection.\n",
    "- `LinkedList<T>` \u2013 doubly linked list (less common, but useful for frequent insertions/removals in the middle).\n",

    "## 4.4 Introduction to LINQ (Language Integrated Query)\n",
    "\n",
    "**LINQ** is one of the most powerful features in C#. It allows you to write declarative queries against collections (and many other data sources) using a syntax that resembles SQL or functional programming constructs. LINQ methods are part of the `System.Linq` namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up\n",
    "\n",
    "To use LINQ, you need to include the namespace:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System.Linq;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most LINQ methods are extension methods that work on any type implementing `IEnumerable<T>` \u2013 which includes arrays, `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` (though dictionary returns key\u2011value pairs), and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key LINQ Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover the most essential ones: `Where`, `Select`, and `First`/`FirstOrDefault`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Where` \u2013 Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "`Where` returns a new collection containing only the elements that satisfy a given condition (a predicate).\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get all even numbers\n",
    "IEnumerable<int> evens = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);\n",
    "\n",
    "foreach (int even in evens)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(even); // 2,4,6,8,10\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda expression `n => n % 2 == 0` is a function that takes an integer `n` and returns `true` if it's even. LINQ methods accept such predicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Select` \u2013 Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "`Select` transforms each element in the collection into a new form. For example, you might want to extract a property or compute a new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "List<string> names = new List<string> { \"alice\", \"bob\", \"charlie\" };\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get the lengths of each name\n",
    "IEnumerable<int> nameLengths = names.Select(name => name.Length);\n",
    "\n",
    "foreach (int len in nameLengths)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(len); // 5,3,7\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Convert to uppercase\n",
    "IEnumerable<string> upperNames = names.Select(name => name.ToUpper());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also project to anonymous types (useful when you need a few properties):\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var nameInfo = names.Select(name => new { Name = name, Length = name.Length });\n",
    "foreach (var info in nameInfo)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine($\"{info.Name} has {info.Length} letters.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `First` and `FirstOrDefault` \u2013 Getting a Single Element\n",
    "\n",
    "- `First()` returns the first element of a collection. If the collection is empty, it throws `InvalidOperationException`.\n",
    "- `FirstOrDefault()` returns the first element or the default value for the type (e.g., `null` for reference types, `0` for numeric types) if the collection is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass a predicate to get the first element matching a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 10, 20, 30, 40 };\n",
    "\n",
    "int first = numbers.First();                // 10\n",
    "int firstEven = numbers.First(n => n % 2 == 0); // 10 (first even)\n",
    "int firstOver100 = numbers.FirstOrDefault(n => n > 100); // 0 (default int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For dictionaries, you might use these methods on the `Keys` or `Values` collections, but it's more common to use `TryGetValue` for key lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Syntax vs. Method Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "LINQ provides two forms: **method syntax** (the one we just used, with extension methods) and **query syntax** (which resembles SQL). Query syntax is translated by the compiler into method calls. Here's an example of query syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var evens = from n in numbers\n",
    "            where n % 2 == 0\n",
    "            select n;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to `numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0).Select(n => n)` (the `Select` is implicit in query syntax if you just select the element). Most developers use method syntax because it's more consistent with the rest of C#, but query syntax can be more readable for complex queries. We'll stick to method syntax in this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deferred Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "An important concept in LINQ is **deferred execution**: many LINQ methods (like `Where` and `Select`) do not execute immediately. They return an `IEnumerable<T>` that represents the query, and the actual work is delayed until you iterate over the results (e.g., with `foreach` or by calling `ToList()`). This can improve performance and allows you to compose queries dynamically.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "numbers.Add(5);\n",

    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(name); // Alice, Charlie\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use a `Dictionary<string, int>` to store student names and grades.\n",
    "- A `while` loop repeatedly prompts for input until the user types \"quit\".\n",
    "- We use `studentGrades[name] = grade;` to add or update an entry. The indexer adds the key if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "- After input, we use various LINQ methods:\n",
    "  - `Any()` checks if the dictionary is non\u2011empty.\n",
    "  - `Values.Average()` computes the average of all grades.\n",
    "  - `Values.Max()` finds the maximum grade.\n",
    "  - `Where` with a predicate to find all students with that grade.\n",
    "  - `Select` to extract just the names.\n",
    "  - `string.Join` to concatenate names into a single string.\n",
    "  - `Keys.OrderBy` to sort the student names alphabetically.\n",
    "  - `OrderByDescending` on the key\u2011value pairs to sort by grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates real\u2011world usage: collecting data, storing it in an appropriate collection, and then querying it with LINQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.6 Common Pitfalls and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Choosing the Right Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `List<T>` for an ordered list of items that you'll access by index or iterate over.\n",
    "- Use `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` for fast lookups by a unique key.\n",
    "- Use `HashSet<T>` when you need to store unique items and test membership.\n",
    "- Use arrays when the size is absolutely fixed and you need maximum performance or interop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Null Reference Exceptions with Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections can be `null`. Always ensure they are initialized before use. Prefer initializing at declaration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "private List<string> names = new List<string>(); // never null\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Modifying Collections During Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, you cannot add or remove items from a collection while iterating with `foreach`. If you need to modify, either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterate backwards with a `for` loop.\n",
    "- Create a copy of the collection to iterate over (e.g., `foreach (var item in list.ToList())`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. LINQ Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "LINQ is convenient, but it can hide performance costs. For example, calling `Count()` on an `IEnumerable` that is not a collection may enumerate the entire sequence. Prefer using the `Count` property of `List<T>` or `Array` when available. Also, be mindful of multiple enumerations: if you write `if (query.Any()) ... foreach (var x in query) ...`, the query is executed twice. Consider materializing with `ToList()` if you need to reuse the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Dictionary Key Lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "Always use `TryGetValue` when you're not sure if a key exists. The indexer throws an exception, which can be costly. `TryGetValue` is efficient and gives you both existence check and value in one operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Using `var` with LINQ\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common to use `var` for LINQ results because the types can be complex (e.g., `IEnumerable<AnonymousType>`). However, be cautious when the result is materialized to a concrete type \u2013 it's still clear enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.7 Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you've learned how to work with groups of data using C# collections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arrays** \u2013 fixed\u2011size, zero\u2011based indexed collections, useful for simple scenarios.\n",
    "- **`List<T>`** \u2013 dynamic, resizable list, the go\u2011to collection for most situations.\n",
    "- **`Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`** \u2013 key\u2011value pairs for fast lookups.\n",
    "- **`foreach` loop** \u2013 the idiomatic way to iterate over collections, and how it works under the hood with `IEnumerable`.\n",
    "- **LINQ** \u2013 a declarative way to query collections using methods like `Where`, `Select`, `FirstOrDefault`, and many others. You learned about deferred execution and how to compose queries.\n",
    "- A practical example tying everything together.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these tools, you can now handle data in bulk \u2013 filter, transform, aggregate, and sort. Collections and LINQ are used constantly in real\u2011world C# development, so mastering them is a major step forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, **Methods \u2013 The Building Blocks of Logic**, we'll explore how to encapsulate code into reusable units, pass data in and out, and design clean, modular programs. You'll learn about method signatures, parameters (including `ref`, `out`, `in`), overloading, and more. Get ready to elevate your code organisation!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a program that stores a list of integers entered by the user. When the user enters 0, stop and display the sum, average, and maximum of the numbers (using LINQ).\n",
    "2. Create a dictionary that maps country codes (e.g., \"us\", \"fr\") to country names. Write a loop that asks the user for a code and prints the corresponding country, handling unknown codes gracefully.\n",
    "3. Given an array of strings, use LINQ to find all strings that start with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) and convert them to uppercase.\n",
    "4. Write a method that takes a `List<int>` and returns a new list with only the unique numbers (hint: use `Distinct` LINQ method).\n",
    "5. Build a simple word counter: read a sentence from the user, split it into words, and use a dictionary to count how many times each word appears. Display the results.\n",
