    "# Chapter 3: Control Flow in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs would be incredibly boring if they just executed statements one after another from top to bottom. The real power of programming comes from making decisions, repeating actions, and jumping to different parts of the code based on conditions. This is called **control flow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you’ll learn how to control the execution path of your C# programs using:\n",
    "- **Boolean logic** and **comparison operators** to build conditions.\n",
    "- **Conditional statements** (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`) to make decisions.\n",
    "- **Loops** (`for`, `foreach`, `while`, `do-while`) to repeat code.\n",
    "- **Jump statements** (`break`, `continue`, `return`) to alter the natural flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you’ll be able to write dynamic, responsive programs that react to user input, process collections of data, and execute logic efficiently.\n",

    "## 3.1 Boolean Logic and Comparison Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can make decisions, we need a way to express conditions. In C#, conditions are expressions that evaluate to a `bool` – either `true` or `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators compare two values and return a `bool`:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Meaning               | Example        | Result (if x = 5) |\n",
    "|----------|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| `==`     | Equal to              | `x == 5`       | `true`            |\n",
    "| `!=`     | Not equal to          | `x != 5`       | `false`           |\n",
    "| `<`      | Less than             | `x < 5`        | `false`           |\n",
    "| `>`      | Greater than          | `x > 5`        | `false`           |\n",
    "| `<=`     | Less than or equal to | `x <= 5`       | `true`            |\n",
    "| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `x >= 5`    | `true`            |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** The equality operator is `==`, not `=`. A single `=` is the assignment operator. Mixing them up is a common source of bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators combine multiple boolean expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Meaning | Example                          | Result                 |\n",
    "|----------|---------|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| `&&`     | Logical AND (both must be true) | `(x > 0) && (x < 10)` | `true` if x is between 1 and 9 |\n",
    "| `\\|\\|`   | Logical OR (at least one true)  | `(x < 0) \\|\\| (x > 10)` | `true` if x is outside 0‑10 |\n",
    "| `!`      | Logical NOT (negation)          | `!(x == 5)`          | `true` if x is not 5 |\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators use **short‑circuit evaluation**: for `&&`, if the left operand is `false`, the right operand is not evaluated (because the whole expression will be `false` regardless). Similarly, for `||`, if the left operand is `true`, the right operand is not evaluated. This can prevent errors when the right operand has side effects or might be invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Combining Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int age = 25;\n",
    "bool isTeenager = age >= 13 && age <= 19;\n",
    "bool canDrinkInUS = age >= 21;\n",
    "bool canDrive = age >= 16;\n",
    "\n",
    "if (canDrive && !canDrinkInUS)\n",
    "{\n",

    "## 3.2 Conditional Statements: `if`, `else if`, `else`\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental way to make decisions in code is the `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic `if`\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "if (condition)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // code executed if condition is true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the condition is `true`, the code inside the braces runs. If it's `false`, it's skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int temperature = 30;\n",
    "if (temperature > 25)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"It's a hot day!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding an `else` Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` clause runs when the condition is `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "if (temperature > 25)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"It's a hot day!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"It's not a hot day.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Conditions with `else if`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have more than two possibilities, use `else if`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "if (temperature >= 35)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"It's scorching hot!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else if (temperature >= 25)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"It's warm.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else if (temperature >= 15)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"It's cool.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"It's cold.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditions are evaluated in order. As soon as one is `true`, its block executes and the rest are skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Curly Braces – Always Use Them!\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if a block contains only one statement, it's good practice to always use curly braces. This avoids bugs when you later add another line and forget to add braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// This works, but is error‑prone\n",
    "if (temperature > 25)\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"Hot day!\");\n",
    "\n",
    "// Better\n",
    "if (temperature > 25)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"Hot day!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested `if` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "You can nest `if` statements inside each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "bool isLoggedIn = true;\n",
    "bool isAdmin = false;\n",
    "\n",
    "if (isLoggedIn)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    if (isAdmin)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome, admin!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome, user!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"Please log in.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes nested `if`s can be simplified with logical operators. For example, the above could be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "if (isLoggedIn && isAdmin)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome, admin!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else if (isLoggedIn && !isAdmin)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome, user!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"Please log in.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose whichever is clearer in your specific case.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 The `switch` Statement – Classic and Switch Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a single value that you want to compare against many possible constants, the `switch` statement can be more readable than a long chain of `if-else if`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classic `switch`\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Console.Write(\"Enter a day number (1-7): \");\n",
    "string? input = Console.ReadLine();\n",
    "int dayNumber = int.Parse(input!); // We'll ignore error handling for now\n",
    "\n",

    "        break;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(dayName);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Important elements:\n",
    "- Each `case` label specifies a constant value to compare against.\n",
    "- The `break` statement exits the switch. Without it, execution would \"fall through\" to the next case (C# does not allow implicit fall‑through except when a case is empty – you must explicitly use `goto` or have no statements).\n",
    "- The `default` case handles any value not matched by previous cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Switch with Multiple Case Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine multiple cases that should execute the same code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "switch (dayNumber)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    case 1:\n",
    "    case 2:\n",
    "    case 3:\n",

    "    case 7:\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Weekend\");\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "    default:\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid\");\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Switch Expressions (C# 8+)\n",
    "\n",
    "C# 8 introduced a more concise syntax using **switch expressions**. They are expressions, not statements, meaning they produce a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string dayName = dayNumber switch\n",
    "{\n",
    "    1 => \"Monday\",\n",
    "    2 => \"Tuesday\",\n",
    "    3 => \"Wednesday\",\n",
    "    4 => \"Thursday\",\n",
    "    5 => \"Friday\",\n",
    "    6 => \"Saturday\",\n",
    "    7 => \"Sunday\",\n",
    "    _ => \"Invalid day number\"\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `switch` keyword comes after the value being matched.\n",
    "- Each arm consists of a pattern (`1`, `2`, etc.) followed by `=>` and the resulting value.\n",
    "- The `_` is the **discard pattern**, equivalent to `default`.\n",
    "- Arms are separated by commas.\n",
    "- The entire expression must end with a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Switch expressions are often more readable and encourage a functional style. They also support more advanced **pattern matching**, which we'll explore in Chapter 17.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3.4 Loops: Repeating Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. C# provides four types of loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `for` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop is ideal when you know in advance how many times you want to iterate. It has three parts: initialization, condition, and iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "for (initializer; condition; iterator)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // loop body\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Counting from 1 to 10**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(i);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int i = 1;` runs once at the beginning.\n",
    "- `i <= 10;` is checked before each iteration. If `true`, the body executes.\n",
    "- `i++` runs after each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `for` loops to iterate over arrays as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30, 40 };\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine($\"Element {i} = {numbers[i]}\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `foreach` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `foreach` loop is the simplest way to iterate over collections (like arrays, lists, and anything that implements `IEnumerable`). You don't need to manage an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "foreach (type element in collection)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // use element\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string[] fruits = { \"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\" };\n",
    "foreach (string fruit in fruits)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(fruit);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For each iteration, `fruit` is assigned the next element from the array. You cannot modify the collection during iteration (it would throw an exception), but you can read its values.\n",
    "\n",
    "`foreach` is generally more readable and less error‑prone than `for` when you don't need the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop executes a block as long as a condition is `true`. The condition is checked *before* each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "while (condition)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // loop body\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Reading input until the user types \"quit\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string? input;\n",
    "while ((input = Console.ReadLine()) != \"quit\")\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine($\"You entered: {input}\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This reads lines and echoes them until the user types \"quit\". Note the parentheses around the assignment – we need to ensure the assignment happens before the comparison. The condition is `(input = Console.ReadLine()) != \"quit\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `do-while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `do-while` loop is similar to `while`, but it guarantees that the body executes **at least once** because the condition is checked after the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "do\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // loop body\n",
    "} while (condition);\n",

    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int number;\n",
    "bool isValid;\n",
    "do\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.Write(\"Enter a positive number: \");\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we always prompt the user at least once, then repeat if the input was invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `for` when you know the number of iterations in advance (e.g., iterating with an index).\n",
    "- Use `foreach` to iterate over a collection when you don't need the index.\n",
    "- Use `while` when the number of iterations is not known and the loop may not execute at all.\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Main` method uses a `while` loop to keep showing the menu until the user chooses exit.\n",
    "- `MainMenu` displays options and uses a `switch` statement to call the appropriate method. It returns `true` to continue or `false` to exit.\n",
    "- `PrintNumbers` demonstrates `continue` and `break` inside a `for` loop.\n",
    "- `GuessingGame` uses a `do-while` loop to ensure the user gets at least one prompt, and uses `if-else if` to give hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a real‑world pattern you'll see often: a menu‑driven console application with loops and conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.7 Common Pitfalls and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Using `=` instead of `==` in Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int x = 5;\n",
    "if (x = 10) // Compiler error: cannot implicitly convert int to bool\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler catches this because `x = 10` is an assignment that returns `10`, not a `bool`. However, if you accidentally use `=` with a boolean variable, it's valid and can be a bug:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "bool done = false;\n",
    "if (done = true) // This assigns true to done, and the condition is always true!\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // This block always executes\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this, you can put the constant on the left (`if (true == done)`) – but that's less readable. Better to enable compiler warnings or use a style rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Off‑by‑One Errors in Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `for` loops, be careful with the condition. If you want to iterate an array of length `n`, indices go from `0` to `n-1`. A common mistake is to use `<=` when you should use `<`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[] arr = { 1, 2, 3 };\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i <= arr.Length; i++) // Bug: i goes 0,1,2,3 – index 3 is out of range\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(arr[i]); // Throws IndexOutOfRangeException when i = 3\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct: `i < arr.Length`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Infinite Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Always ensure your loop condition will eventually become `false`. For example, forgetting to increment the counter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int i = 0;\n",
    "while (i < 10)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(i);\n",
    "    // i never increments – infinite loop!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Switch Fall‑Through\n",
    "\n",
    "In classic `switch`, forgetting a `break` (unless you have no statements) causes a compiler error. This is good – C# prevents accidental fall‑through. But if you intentionally want to share code, either use multiple case labels with no body, or use `goto case` (though that's rarely needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Prefer `foreach` Over `for` When Possible\n",
    "\n",
    "`foreach` is more expressive and eliminates off‑by‑one errors. Use it unless you need the index or are modifying the collection (which you shouldn't do during iteration anyway).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.8 Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you've mastered the fundamental control flow mechanisms in C#:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boolean logic** with comparison and logical operators to build conditions.\n",
    "- **Conditional statements** (`if`, `else if`, `else`) for decision making.\n",
    "- **Switch statements** and **switch expressions** for multi‑way branching based on a single value.\n",
    "- **Loops** (`for`, `foreach`, `while`, `do-while`) to repeat code.\n",
    "- **Jump statements** (`break`, `continue`, `return`) to alter loop or method flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've also seen how to combine these constructs to build interactive applications like a menu system and a guessing game.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these tools, you can write programs that respond to user input, process data, and implement complex logic. In the next chapter, **Working with Data - Collections**, we'll explore how to store and manipulate groups of data using arrays, lists, dictionaries, and LINQ – essential skills for any real‑world application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.\n",
    "2. Create a simple calculator that repeatedly asks for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and displays the result, until the user enters 'q' to quit.\n",
    "3. Use a `for` loop to print a multiplication table for a number entered by the user.\n",
    "4. Modify the guessing game to limit the number of attempts to 5. If the user hasn't guessed correctly after 5 tries, reveal the number and end the game.\n",
    "5. Experiment with `switch` expressions: write a method that returns a string describing the season based on a month number (1‑12).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll dive into collections – the powerful ways C# lets you work with groups of data."
