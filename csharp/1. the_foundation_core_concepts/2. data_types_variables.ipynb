    "# Chapter 2: Data Types & Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you can write and run a simple C# program, it’s time to dive into the heart of any programming language: **data**. In C#, every piece of data has a **type** that defines what kind of value it can hold and what operations can be performed on it. Understanding types is crucial because C# is a **statically‑typed** language – the type of every variable is known at compile time, which helps catch errors early and improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we’ll explore the built‑in data types, learn how to declare and initialize variables, and understand the fundamental difference between **value types** and **reference types**. We’ll also look at the handy `var` keyword and nullable value types. Let’s get started!\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Value Types vs. Reference Types – The Fundamental Distinction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important concepts in C# is the division of types into two categories: **value types** and **reference types**. This distinction affects how data is stored, copied, and passed around.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables of value types directly contain their data. When you assign one value type variable to another, the value is **copied**. Each variable operates on its own independent copy of the data. Value types are typically stored on the **stack**, which provides fast access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of value types:\n",
    "- All numeric types (`int`, `double`, `float`, `decimal`, etc.)\n",
    "- `bool`\n",
    "- `char`\n",
    "- `struct` (including custom structs)\n",
    "- `enum`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables of reference types store a **reference** (or pointer) to the actual data, which lives on the **heap**. When you assign one reference type variable to another, only the reference is copied – both variables now refer to the same object in memory. Changes made through one variable are visible through the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of reference types:\n",
    "- `string` (although it behaves like a value type in some ways, it’s a reference type)\n",
    "- `class` (including custom classes)\n",
    "- `interface`\n",
    "- `array` (even arrays of value types are reference types)\n",
    "- `delegate`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Illustrating the Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see this in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Value type example (int)\n",
    "int a = 10;\n",
    "int b = a;       // b gets a *copy* of the value\n",
    "b = 20;\n",
    "Console.WriteLine($\"a = {a}, b = {b}\"); // Output: a = 10, b = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "// Reference type example (array)\n",
    "int[] arr1 = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };\n",
    "int[] arr2 = arr1;   // arr2 now references the SAME array as arr1\n",
    "arr2[0] = 99;\n",
    "Console.WriteLine($\"arr1[0] = {arr1[0]}, arr2[0] = {arr2[0]}\"); // Output: arr1[0] = 99, arr2[0] = 99\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part, `a` and `b` are independent. Changing `b` does not affect `a`. In the second part, `arr1` and `arr2` point to the same array object, so modifying an element through `arr2` is visible when accessed through `arr1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Note on `string`\n",
    "\n",
    "`string` is a reference type, but it is **immutable** – once created, its value cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string object. This gives `string` value‑like behaviour, but it’s still a reference type under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string s1 = \"Hello\";\n",
    "string s2 = s1;       // s2 references the same string\n",
    "s2 = \"World\";         // s2 now references a new string; s1 remains \"Hello\"\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(s1); // Output: Hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Predefined Data Types\n",

    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Numeric Type\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **whole numbers**, `int` is the default. Use `long` if you need larger values. Use `short` or `byte` when memory is extremely constrained (rare in application programming).\n",
    "- For **floating‑point numbers**, `double` is the default. Use `float` if you need to save memory and precision is less critical (e.g., graphics). Use `decimal` for financial or monetary calculations where exact decimal representation is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Using different numeric types**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int population = 8_000_000_000;       // underscores improve readability (C# 7.0+)\n",
    "double pi = 3.141592653589793;\n",
    "decimal price = 19.99m;                // 'm' suffix indicates a decimal literal\n",
    "float temperature = 98.6f;              // 'f' suffix for float\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the `m` and `f` suffixes – they tell the compiler that the literal is of type `decimal` or `float`; otherwise, a number with a decimal point is treated as `double`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boolean Type\n",
    "\n",
    "`bool` can hold only `true` or `false`. It is often used in conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "bool isRaining = true;\n",
    "bool haveUmbrella = false;\n",
    "\n",
    "if (isRaining && !haveUmbrella)\n",
    "{\n",

    "char symbol = '©';\n",
    "char emoji = '😊'; // Yes, C# supports Unicode fully!\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Declaring and Initializing Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In C#, you must declare a variable before using it. Declaration specifies the type and the name. Initialization gives it an initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "type variableName;          // declaration\n",
    "variableName = value;       // assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "type variableName = value;  // declaration + initialization\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int age;                    // declaration\n",
    "age = 30;                   // assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "string name = \"Alice\";      // declaration + initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "double result;               // declared but not yet used – valid, but must be assigned before reading\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Declarations\n",
    "\n",
    "You can declare multiple variables of the same type in one line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int x = 10, y = 20, z;      // z is declared but not initialized\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicitly Typed Local Variables (`var`)\n",
    "\n",
    "C# provides the `var` keyword to tell the compiler to infer the type from the initializer. This is called **implicit typing**. The variable is still statically typed – the compiler determines the type at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var message = \"Hello\";       // message is of type string\n",
    "var count = 42;              // count is of type int\n",
    "var price = 9.99m;           // price is of type decimal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules for `var`:\n",
    "- You must initialize the variable at declaration.\n",
    "- You cannot use `var` without an initializer.\n",
    "- You cannot use `var` for fields (class‑level variables) – only for local variables inside methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use `var`? It’s a matter of style. Many developers use `var` when the type is obvious from the right‑hand side (e.g., `var dict = new Dictionary<string, int>();`). Others prefer to always write the type explicitly. The important thing is consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constant Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a value that never changes, you can declare it as a constant using the `const` keyword. Constants are implicitly static and must be initialized at declaration. They are evaluated at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "const double Pi = 3.14159;\n",
    "const int DaysInWeek = 7;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Pi = 3.14; // Error! Cannot change a constant\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants are always value types or the `string` type (because `string` is a reference type but has a literal representation). For other reference types, you can use `static readonly` (covered later).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Nullable Value Types\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, value types cannot be `null`. For example, you cannot set an `int` to `null` because an `int` must always have a numeric value. However, there are scenarios where you want to represent the absence of a value – for example, a database field that can be `NULL`, or an optional configuration setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "C# solves this with **nullable value types**, denoted by a `?` after the type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int? age = null;            // age can now hold an int or null\n",
    "bool? isAvailable = true;   // can be true, false, or null\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A nullable value type is actually an instance of `Nullable<T>` (where `T` is the underlying value type). It has two useful properties:\n",
    "- `HasValue` – a boolean indicating whether the variable contains a non‑null value.\n",
    "- `Value` – the underlying value (throws an exception if `HasValue` is false).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working with nullable value types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int? maybeNumber = GetNullableInt(); // suppose this returns null or a number\n",
    "\n",
    "if (maybeNumber.HasValue)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine($\"The number is {maybeNumber.Value}\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"No number was provided.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Null‑Coalescing Operator `??`\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you want to provide a default value when a nullable is `null`. The `??` operator does exactly that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int? maybe = null;\n",
    "int definite = maybe ?? 42;           // definite becomes 42\n",
    "\n",
    "string? name = GetName();              // suppose this might return null\n",
    "string displayName = name ?? \"Unknown\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Null‑Conditional Operator `?.`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also safely access members of a nullable value type (or reference type) using the `?.` operator. If the variable is `null`, the expression returns `null` without throwing an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int? length = text?.Length;   // if text is null, length becomes null\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially useful with reference types, but works for nullable value types as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.5 Putting It All Together: A Practical Example\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2.6 Common Pitfalls and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Uninitialized Variables\n",
    "Local variables must be assigned a value before they are read. The compiler enforces this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int x;\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(x); // Compiler error: Use of unassigned local variable 'x'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Overflow Checking\n",
    "By default, integer arithmetic in an unchecked context does not throw an exception on overflow; it wraps around. You can enable overflow checking with the `checked` keyword or a compiler option.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int max = int.MaxValue;\n",
    "int result = checked(max + 1); // Throws OverflowException\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For performance‑sensitive code, you might leave it unchecked, but for safety, consider using `checked` where overflow could cause issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Prefer `decimal` for Financial Calculations\n",
    "Floating‑point types (`float`, `double`) are binary fractions and cannot represent many decimal numbers exactly (e.g., 0.1). For money, always use `decimal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "double d1 = 0.1;\n",
    "double d2 = 0.2;\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(d1 + d2 == 0.3); // False – precision error\n",
    "\n",
    "decimal m1 = 0.1m;\n",
    "decimal m2 = 0.2m;\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(m1 + m2 == 0.3m); // True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use `nameof` for String Literals\n",
    "When you need to refer to a variable or member name as a string (e.g., for logging, argument exceptions), use `nameof` to avoid hard‑coding strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "void PrintName(string personName)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    if (personName == null)\n",
    "        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(personName));\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(personName);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you later rename the parameter, `nameof` will update automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Nullable Reference Types (C# 8+)\n",
    "In modern C#, reference types can also be made nullable with the `?` annotation (e.g., `string?`). This is a feature that helps prevent null reference exceptions. We’ll cover it in depth later, but be aware that the compiler can warn you about potential null dereferences if you enable it.\n",

    "## 2.7 Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we’ve laid the groundwork for handling data in C#. You now understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The crucial difference between **value types** (stored directly, copied by value) and **reference types** (stored indirectly, copied by reference).\n",
    "- The most common built‑in data types: `int`, `double`, `decimal`, `bool`, `char`, `string`, and their appropriate use cases.\n",
    "- How to declare, initialize, and use variables, including the `var` keyword for implicit typing.\n",
    "- How to represent optional values with **nullable value types** (`int?`) and safely work with them using `HasValue`, `Value`, and the `??` operator.\n",
    "- Best practices like using `decimal` for money, `checked` for overflow safety, and `nameof` for string references.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are the foundation of all C# programs. In the next chapter, we’ll build on this knowledge to control the flow of execution using conditional statements and loops – the logic that makes our programs dynamic and responsive.\n",

    "1. Write a program that declares variables of each built‑in type, assigns them values, and prints them to the console.\n",
    "2. Experiment with nullable types: declare an `int?` variable, set it to `null`, then try to use it with `??` to provide a default.\n",
    "3. Create a small program that asks the user for their birth year, stores it as an `int`, and calculates their age. Use `int.TryParse` to handle invalid input.\n",
    "4. Demonstrate the difference between value and reference types by creating a simple `struct` and a simple `class` with the same fields, then modify copies and observe the behaviour.\n",
