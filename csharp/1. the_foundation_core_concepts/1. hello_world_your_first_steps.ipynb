    "\n",
    "Welcome to the beginning of your C# journey! In this chapter, we\u2019ll write our first C# program and explore the fundamental concepts that every C# developer needs to understand. By the end, you\u2019ll not only have a working \u201cHello, World!\u201d application but also a solid grasp of how C# code is transformed into a running program, the role of the `Main` method, and how to interact with the user through the console.\n",

    "## 1.1 Understanding the .NET Compilation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into code, it\u2019s important to understand what happens when you write, build, and run a C# program. This knowledge will help you appreciate the .NET ecosystem and troubleshoot issues later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Source Code to Running Application\n",
    "\n",
    "C# is a **compiled language**, but it\u2019s not compiled directly into machine code like C or C++. Instead, it goes through a two\u2011step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compilation to Intermediate Language (IL)**  \n",
    "   When you build your C# project (using `dotnet build` or your IDE), the C# compiler (`Roslyn`) translates your source code into an intermediate language called **Common Intermediate Language (CIL)**, often shortened to **IL**. IL is a low\u2011level, platform\u2011agnostic set of instructions. It\u2019s similar in spirit to bytecode in Java. The output is an *assembly* \u2013 either an executable (`.exe`) or a dynamic link library (`.dll`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Just\u2011In\u2011Time (JIT) Compilation to Native Code**  \n",
    "   When you run your application, the .NET runtime (specifically the **Common Language Runtime \u2013 CLR**) loads the IL code. As each method is called for the first time, the **JIT compiler** translates that IL into native machine code that the CPU can execute directly. The native code is then cached so that subsequent calls are fast. This two\u2011step process gives C# its unique blend of portability (IL can run on any platform with a CLR) and performance (native code is executed at runtime).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** You might also hear about **Ahead\u2011of\u2011Time (AOT) compilation**, which translates IL to native code *before* execution. This is used in scenarios like iOS development or when you need the fastest possible startup time. However, for most applications, JIT is the default and works wonderfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Simple Illustration\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you write this tiny program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The compiler produces an IL version of `Console.WriteLine` and the string literal.\n",
    "- When you run the program, the CLR starts, loads the IL, and the JIT compiler translates the IL for `Console.WriteLine` into machine code just before it executes.\n",
    "- The machine code then prints the text to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this process demystifies many later concepts, such as the startup performance of applications and why sometimes the first execution of a method is slightly slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 The `Main` Method \u2013 The Traditional Entry Point\n",
    "\n",
    "Every C# executable application needs an **entry point** \u2013 the place where the program starts executing. In traditional C# (before C# 9), this entry point is a special method named `Main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of the `Main` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here\u2019s the classic \u201cHello, World!\u201d using an explicit `Main` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace HelloWorld\n",
    "{\n",
    "    class Program\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        static void Main(string[] args)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\u2019s break down every piece:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `using System;`  \n",
    "  This line tells the compiler that we want to use types from the `System` namespace. The `Console` class, which we use for input/output, lives in `System`. Without this line, we would have to write `System.Console.WriteLine(...)`. Namespaces help organise code and avoid naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `namespace HelloWorld;`  \n",
    "  A namespace is a container for related classes. Here we define a namespace called `HelloWorld`. It\u2019s a good practice to wrap your code in a namespace that reflects your project or organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `class Program`  \n",
    "  In C#, everything lives inside a class (or record, struct, etc.). Here we define a class named `Program`. The name `Program` is conventional, but you can name it anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `static void Main(string[] args)`  \n",
    "  This is the `Main` method.  \n",
    "  - `static` means the method belongs to the class itself, not to an instance of the class. The runtime calls this method without creating an object first.  \n",
    "  - `void` indicates that the method does not return a value.  \n",
    "  - `Main` is the method name. By convention, it\u2019s capitalised.  \n",
    "  - `string[] args` is a parameter that receives any command\u2011line arguments passed to the program. Even if you don\u2019t use them, you can keep the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside the method: `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");`  \n",
    "  This line prints the text to the console. `WriteLine` is a method of the `Console` class that outputs a line of text followed by a newline character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variations of the `Main` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Main` method can have different signatures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `static void Main()` \u2013 no parameters, no return value.\n",
    "- `static int Main()` \u2013 returns an integer exit code (often used to signal success or failure to the operating system).\n",
    "- `static int Main(string[] args)` \u2013 returns an exit code and receives arguments.\n",
    "- `static Task Main()` \u2013 for asynchronous entry points (we\u2019ll cover `async` later).\n",
    "- `static Task<int> Main(string[] args)` \u2013 async with exit code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example using command\u2011line arguments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace GreetApp\n",
    "{\n",
    "    class Program\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        static void Main(string[] args)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            if (args.Length > 0)\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                Console.WriteLine($\"Hello, {args[0]}!\");\n",
    "            }\n",
    "            else\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run this program with `dotnet run -- Alice`, it prints `Hello, Alice!`. The `--` tells `dotnet run` to pass the rest to your program. The `args` array contains each argument as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Best Practice:** Even if you don\u2019t use `args`, it\u2019s common to keep the parameter because you might need it later. However, with top\u2011level statements (see next section), you can access `args` without declaring it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Top\u2011Level Statements \u2013 The Modern Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with C# 9, you can write programs without explicitly wrapping everything in a namespace, class, and `Main` method. This is called **top\u2011level statements**. The compiler generates the necessary boilerplate for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hello, World! with Top\u2011Level Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file (e.g., `Program.cs`) and write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System;\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That\u2019s it! You can run this and it will work exactly like the traditional version. The compiler infers the entry point and generates a `Main` method that contains your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler takes all top\u2011level statements (code that is not inside a namespace, class, or method) and places them inside a generated `Main` method. The generated code is roughly equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System;\n",
    "\n",
    "static class Program\n",
    "{\n",
    "    static void Main()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(It may also generate a namespace and class with a unique name.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Command\u2011Line Arguments with Top\u2011Level Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with top\u2011level statements, you can access command\u2011line arguments through a special variable named `args`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System;\n",
    "\n",
    "if (args.Length > 0)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine($\"Hello, {args[0]}!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `args` variable is implicitly available \u2013 you don\u2019t need to declare it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Async and Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `await` and return an exit code directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System;\n",
    "using System.Threading.Tasks;\n",
    "\n",
    "await Task.Delay(1000); // wait 1 second\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(\"Done!\");\n",
    "\n",
    "return 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler treats the code as if it were inside an asynchronous `Main` that returns a `Task<int>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Top\u2011Level Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Top\u2011level statements are fantastic for:\n",
    "- Simple programs, scripts, and educational examples.\n",
    "- Prototyping and small utilities.\n",
    "- Reducing ceremony when you\u2019re just getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "For larger applications, you might still prefer explicit `Main` methods because they make the structure clearer, especially when you have multiple classes. However, many modern .NET templates (like console apps) now use top\u2011level statements by default. As a developer, you\u2019ll encounter both styles, so it\u2019s essential to understand both.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Basic Console I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we can write a program, let\u2019s make it interactive. The `Console` class provides simple methods for reading and writing text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputting Text\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Console.WriteLine(\"text\");` \u2013 writes the text followed by a newline.\n",
    "- `Console.Write(\"text\");` \u2013 writes the text without a newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can output variables as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int age = 25;\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(\"I am \" + age + \" years old.\");   // concatenation\n",
    "Console.WriteLine($\"I am {age} years old.\");       // string interpolation (preferred)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**String interpolation** (using `$\"...\"`) is the modern, readable way to embed expressions inside strings. Any expression inside `{}` is evaluated and converted to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Input\n",
    "\n",
    "- `string? input = Console.ReadLine();` \u2013 reads a line of text from the user. It returns `null` if the end of the input stream is reached (rare in interactive console apps). The `?` indicates that the variable can hold `null`.\n",
    "- `Console.ReadKey()` \u2013 reads a single key press without requiring Enter. Useful for \u201cpress any key to continue\u201d prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: A simple conversation**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System;\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.Write(\"What is your name? \");\n",
    "string? name = Console.ReadLine();\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.Write(\"How old are you? \");\n",
    "string? ageInput = Console.ReadLine();\n",
    "\n",
    "// Convert the string to an integer (we'll learn about parsing later)\n",
    "if (int.TryParse(ageInput, out int age))\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine($\"Hello, {name}! Next year you will be {age + 1}.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine($\"Hello, {name}! You entered an invalid age.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Console.Write` asks the question without moving to a new line.\n",
    "- `Console.ReadLine` captures the user\u2019s input.\n",
    "- `int.TryParse` safely attempts to convert the input string to an integer. If successful, it stores the value in the `age` variable and returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. This avoids exceptions if the user enters non\u2011numeric text.\n",
    "- We then use string interpolation to display a personalised message.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** `ReadLine` returns a `string?` because in some scenarios (like redirected input) it can return `null`. For simple console apps, you can safely assume it returns a non\u2011null string and use the null\u2011forgiving operator: `string name = Console.ReadLine()!;`. However, it\u2019s better to handle the possibility of `null` properly. We\u2019ll discuss nullable reference types in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading a Key Press\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit...\");\n",
    "Console.ReadKey(); // waits for a key press\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`ReadKey` returns a `ConsoleKeyInfo` object that contains details about the key pressed (e.g., `Key`, `Modifiers`). You can inspect these if needed.\n",
