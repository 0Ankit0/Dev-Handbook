    "# Chapter 12: Delegates, Events, and Lambda Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've worked with methods as members of classes \u2013 blocks of code that you call directly. But what if you need to pass a method as a parameter to another method? Or store a reference to a method so you can call it later? This is where **delegates** come in. Delegates are objects that reference methods, enabling you to treat methods as first\u2011class citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on delegates, **events** provide a standardized way to implement the publisher/subscriber pattern, where an object notifies other objects when something happens. And **lambda expressions** give you a concise syntax to create delegates inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What delegates are and how to declare and use them.\n",
    "- The built\u2011in delegate types: `Action`, `Func`, and `Predicate`.\n",
    "- **Multicast delegates** \u2013 delegates that can call multiple methods.\n",
    "- **Anonymous methods** and **lambda expressions** as a shorthand.\n",
    "- How to declare and raise **events**.\n",
    "- The `EventHandler` delegate and custom event arguments.\n",
    "- Best practices for events, including thread safety and memory leaks.\n",
    "- A practical example that ties everything together.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll be able to create flexible, decoupled architectures using delegates and events, and write concise inline code with lambdas.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 12.1 What Are Delegates?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **delegate** is a type that represents references to methods with a specific parameter list and return type. When you instantiate a delegate, you can associate it with any method that has a compatible signature. You can then call the method through the delegate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a delegate as a **type\u2011safe function pointer**. They are the foundation of events and callbacks in C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring a Delegate\n",
    "\n",
    "You declare a delegate using the `delegate` keyword, followed by a method signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public delegate int Operation(int x, int y);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This defines a delegate type named `Operation` that can reference any method that takes two `int` parameters and returns an `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a Delegate\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Math\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;\n",
    "    public static int Multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create delegate instances\n",
    "Operation op1 = new Operation(Math.Add);\n",
    "Operation op2 = Math.Multiply; // simplified syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "// Invoke the delegate\n",
    "int result1 = op1(5, 3);        // 8\n",
    "int result2 = op2(5, 3);        // 15\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(result1);\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(result2);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `Invoke` method explicitly: `op1.Invoke(5, 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Delegates?\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegates enable methods to be passed as parameters. This is useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Callbacks** \u2013 execute a method after an operation completes.\n",
    "- **Event handling** \u2013 notify subscribers when something happens.\n",
    "- **LINQ** \u2013 many LINQ methods take delegates (e.g., `Where` expects a `Func<TSource, bool>`).\n",
    "- **Strategy pattern** \u2013 encapsulate an algorithm and make it interchangeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.2 Built\u2011in Delegate Types: `Action`, `Func`, and `Predicate`\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of declaring custom delegates for common patterns, C# provides generic delegate types in the `System` namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Action`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Action` represents a delegate that returns `void` and can take up to 16 parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Action greet = () => Console.WriteLine(\"Hello!\");\n",
    "Action<string> greetWithName = (name) => Console.WriteLine($\"Hello, {name}!\");\n",
    "\n",
    "greet();\n",
    "greetWithName(\"Alice\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Func`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Func` represents a delegate that returns a value. The last type parameter is the return type; the preceding ones are the parameter types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Func<int, int, int> add = (x, y) => x + y;\n",
    "Func<int, int> square = x => x * x;\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(add(3, 4));   // 7\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(square(5));    // 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Predicate`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Predicate<T>` is a delegate that takes one parameter and returns a `bool`. It's equivalent to `Func<T, bool>`, but is often used for conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Predicate<int> isEven = x => x % 2 == 0;\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(isEven(4)); // True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you'll see `Func<T, bool>` used more often than `Predicate`, but both exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "These built\u2011in delegates cover most needs, so you rarely need to declare your own delegate types.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.3 Multicast Delegates\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegates can reference **multiple methods**. This is called a **multicast delegate**. The `+` and `+=` operators combine delegates, and `-` and `-=` remove them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Action notify = () => Console.WriteLine(\"Notification 1\");\n",
    "notify += () => Console.WriteLine(\"Notification 2\");\n",
    "notify += () => Console.WriteLine(\"Notification 3\");\n",
    "\n",
    "notify(); // Calls all three methods in order\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you invoke a multicast delegate, each method is called in the order they were added. If any method throws an exception, subsequent methods may not be called (depending on the delegate type \u2013 for `Action`, they are; for custom delegates, you need to handle manually).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Multicast delegates work for delegates that return `void`. If the delegate has a return type, only the last invoked method's return value is returned; the others are ignored. For this reason, multicast delegates are typically used with `void` delegates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Combining Delegates\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Logger\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static void LogToConsole(string message) => Console.WriteLine($\"Console: {message}\");\n",
    "    public static void LogToFile(string message) => Console.WriteLine($\"File: {message}\"); // simulate\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Action<string> log = Logger.LogToConsole;\n",
    "log += Logger.LogToFile;\n",
    "\n",
    "log(\"Application started\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.4 Anonymous Methods and Lambda Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, you need a small method that you'll only use once. Instead of defining a separate named method, you can use an **anonymous method** or a **lambda expression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anonymous Methods (C# 2.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "An anonymous method is defined using the `delegate` keyword inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Func<int, int, int> add = delegate (int a, int b) { return a + b; };\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(add(3, 4));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda Expressions (C# 3.0 and later)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambdas are a more concise way to write anonymous methods. They use the `=>` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's only one parameter, you can omit parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Func<int, int> square = x => x * x;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the lambda has multiple statements, use curly braces and a `return` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Action<string> greet = name =>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    string message = $\"Hello, {name}!\";\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(message);\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambdas are heavily used in LINQ:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\n",
    "var evens = numbers.Where(x => x % 2 == 0);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capturing Variables (Closures)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambdas can capture variables from the enclosing scope. This is called a **closure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int factor = 2;\n",
    "Func<int, int> multiplier = x => x * factor;\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(multiplier(5)); // 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda \"remembers\" the value of `factor`. Be cautious: if `factor` changes before the lambda is invoked, it sees the current value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.5 Events \u2013 The Publisher/Subscriber Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "An **event** is a special kind of delegate that enforces the publisher/subscriber pattern. The **publisher** class declares the event; **subscribers** attach methods to it. When the event is raised, all subscriber methods are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring an Event\n",
    "\n",
    "You declare an event using the `event` keyword followed by a delegate type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Button\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Declare an event\n",
    "    public event EventHandler Click;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void SimulateClick()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Raise the event (if there are subscribers)\n",
    "        Click?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `EventHandler` is a built\u2011in delegate defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public delegate void EventHandler(object? sender, EventArgs e);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the standard pattern for events in .NET: the sender is the object raising the event, and `EventArgs` contains any additional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subscribing to an Event\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Button button = new Button();\n",
    "button.Click += Button_Click; // subscribe\n",
    "\n",
    "private void Button_Click(object? sender, EventArgs e)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"Button was clicked!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a lambda:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "button.Click += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine(\"Clicked!\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To unsubscribe, use `-=` with the same handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raising Events Safely\n",
    "\n",
    "Always check for `null` before raising, because if there are no subscribers, the event is `null`. The `?.Invoke()` syntax (null\u2011conditional operator) does this safely and atomically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Event Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to pass data with the event, create a class derived from `EventArgs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class TemperatureChangedEventArgs : EventArgs\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public double NewTemperature { get; set; }\n",
    "    public double OldTemperature { get; set; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Thermostat\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private double _temperature;\n",
    "    public event EventHandler<TemperatureChangedEventArgs> TemperatureChanged;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public double Temperature\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        get => _temperature;\n",
    "        set\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            if (_temperature != value)\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                double old = _temperature;\n",
    "                _temperature = value;\n",
    "                OnTemperatureChanged(old, value);\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    protected virtual void OnTemperatureChanged(double oldTemp, double newTemp)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        TemperatureChanged?.Invoke(this, new TemperatureChangedEventArgs \n",
    "        { \n",
    "            OldTemperature = oldTemp, \n",
    "            NewTemperature = newTemp \n",
    "        });\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Subscribers can then access the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "thermostat.TemperatureChanged += (sender, e) =>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine($\"Temperature changed from {e.OldTemperature} to {e.NewTemperature}\");\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.6 EventHandler and EventHandler<T>\n",
    "\n",
    "The .NET framework provides two standard delegate types for events:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EventHandler` \u2013 for events with no data.\n",
    "- `EventHandler<TEventArgs>` \u2013 for events with data, where `TEventArgs` derives from `EventArgs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these ensures consistency across your code and with framework events.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.7 Best Practices for Delegates and Events\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Use the Built\u2011in Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefer `Action`, `Func`, `EventHandler`, and `EventHandler<T>` over custom delegate types unless you have a specific reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Check for Null Before Raising Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Always use `EventName?.Invoke(...)` to avoid `NullReferenceException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Make Events Virtual\n",
    "\n",
    "If your class is designed for inheritance, consider making the event\u2011raising method `protected virtual` so derived classes can override behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Be Careful with Multicast Delegate Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need each subscriber to return a value, use a different pattern (e.g., a list of delegates) because multicast delegates only return the last value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Avoid Memory Leaks with Events\n",
    "\n",
    "When a subscriber subscribes to an event, the publisher holds a reference to the subscriber. If the subscriber goes out of scope but doesn't unsubscribe, it remains alive (garbage collector can't collect it). Always unsubscribe when no longer needed, especially in long\u2011lived objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "button.Click -= Button_Click; // important for cleanup\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Use `nameof` for Event Names\n",
    "\n",
    "When raising events, use `nameof(EventName)` in any logging or debugging to avoid magic strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Keep Lambdas Short\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambdas are great for small logic. If a lambda becomes long or complex, consider extracting it to a named method for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Thread Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "If events can be raised from multiple threads, you need to ensure thread safety. The null\u2011conditional `?.Invoke()` is atomic, but if you need more (like copying the delegate before invoking), do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var handler = TemperatureChanged;\n",
    "if (handler != null)\n",
    "    handler(this, e);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This avoids a race condition where the event becomes null after the check.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.8 Putting It All Together: A Message Broadcaster\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a simple message broadcasting system using delegates and events. We'll have a `Broadcaster` class that raises an event when a message is received, and multiple subscribers that handle the message.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MessageBroadcaster` is the publisher, with an event `MessageReceived` using `EventHandler<MessageEventArgs>`.\n",
    "- `MessageEventArgs` carries the sender and message.\n",
    "- Subscribers (`EmailLogger`, `ConsoleLogger`, `FilteredSubscriber`) attach handlers. They can be instance methods or lambdas.\n",
    "- `FilteredSubscriber` demonstrates conditional handling.\n",
    "- The `Main` method shows subscribing, broadcasting, and unsubscribing.\n",
    "- We also show a simple `Func` delegate and a multicast `Action` to reinforce delegate concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates how events decouple the broadcaster from the subscribers \u2013 the broadcaster doesn't know anything about the subscribers, yet they all receive messages.\n",

    "## 12.9 Common Pitfalls and Best Practices \u2013 Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Delegate vs. Event** \u2013 An event is a wrapper around a delegate that only allows `+=` and `-=` from outside. It prevents subscribers from clearing other subscriptions or invoking the delegate directly.\n",
    "- **Memory Leaks** \u2013 Always unsubscribe from events when the subscriber is no longer needed, especially in long\u2011running applications.\n",
    "- **Exception Handling** \u2013 If a subscriber throws an exception, it may prevent other subscribers from being notified. Consider wrapping subscriber calls in try\u2011catch if you need robustness.\n",
    "- **Lambda Variable Capture** \u2013 Be aware that lambdas capture variables, which can extend the lifetime of objects. This can also cause memory leaks if not careful.\n",
    "- **Use `EventHandler<T>` for Consistency** \u2013 It's the standard pattern; follow it unless you have a compelling reason not to.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.10 Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you've mastered delegates, events, and lambda expressions \u2013 key features for writing flexible and decoupled code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Delegates** are type\u2011safe function pointers that allow methods to be passed as parameters.\n",
    "- **Built\u2011in delegates** `Action`, `Func`, and `Predicate` cover most needs.\n",
    "- **Multicast delegates** can invoke multiple methods.\n",
    "- **Anonymous methods and lambdas** provide concise inline syntax.\n",
    "- **Events** implement the publisher/subscriber pattern, with `EventHandler` as the standard.\n",
    "- **Custom event arguments** let you pass data with events.\n",
    "- Best practices ensure your event\u2011driven code is robust and leak\u2011free.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these tools, you can design systems where components communicate without tight coupling, making your code more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, **Generics \u2013 Code Reusability with Type Safety**, we'll explore how generics allow you to write classes and methods that work with any type while preserving type safety. You'll learn about generic classes, methods, constraints, and covariance/contravariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a method that takes a `List<int>` and a `Predicate<int>` and returns a new list with elements that satisfy the predicate. Test it with different predicates.\n",
    "2. Create a simple `Timer` class that raises an event every second. Use `EventHandler` and test with multiple subscribers.\n",
    "3. Implement a custom `Sort` method that takes a `List<T>` and a `Comparison<T>` delegate (which returns an int) and sorts using that comparison. Test with sorting strings by length.\n",
    "4. Build a simple event-driven calculator: a class `Calculator` that raises events for each operation (Add, Subtract, etc.) and a logger that subscribes and logs operations.\n",
    "5. Experiment with lambda captures: create a list of `Action` delegates inside a loop and see what happens when you invoke them later. Understand why you might need to copy the loop variable.\n",
    "\n",
