    "# Chapter 23: Unit Testing for Quality Code\n",
    "\n",
    "As your codebase grows, manually testing every feature becomes impossible. Changes that work today might break something else tomorrow. **Unit testing** is the practice of writing automated tests that verify the behavior of individual units of code (typically methods or classes) in isolation. Unit tests give you confidence that your code works correctly and continues to work as you refactor or add new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The importance of unit testing and the testing pyramid.\n",
    "- How to set up a unit testing project using **xUnit** (the most popular framework) and **NUnit**.\n",
    "- The structure of a unit test: **Arrange\u2011Act\u2011Assert**.\n",
    "- Using **assertions** to verify expected outcomes.\n",
    "- **Mocking** dependencies with **Moq** to isolate the code under test.\n",
    "- Testing methods that throw exceptions.\n",
    "- **Code coverage** concepts and tools.\n",
    "- Best practices for writing maintainable tests.\n",
    "- A practical example: testing the `OrderService` from Chapter 21.\n",
    "- Integration testing vs. unit testing.\n",

    "By the end, you'll be able to write comprehensive unit tests that protect your code from regressions and document its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.1 Why Unit Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit testing provides numerous benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bug prevention** \u2013 catch errors early in the development cycle.\n",
    "- **Confidence in refactoring** \u2013 change code without fear of breaking existing functionality.\n",
    "- **Documentation** \u2013 tests serve as executable specifications of how code should behave.\n",
    "- **Design feedback** \u2013 if code is hard to test, it's often a sign of poor design (tight coupling, too many responsibilities).\n",
    "- **Faster debugging** \u2013 when a test fails, it's usually clear what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **testing pyramid** suggests that most tests should be unit tests (fast and cheap), with fewer integration tests (testing multiple components together) and even fewer end\u2011to\u2011end tests (testing the whole system).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.2 Setting Up a Unit Testing Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit tests are typically placed in a separate project, following naming conventions like `MyProject.Tests`. You can create one using the .NET CLI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet new xunit -n MyProject.Tests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a project with references to the xUnit framework. Other popular frameworks are NUnit and MSTest. We'll focus on xUnit because it's the default for modern .NET.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a reference to your main project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add reference ../MyProject/MyProject.csproj\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need mocking, also add Moq:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package Moq\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.3 Anatomy of a Unit Test\n",
    "\n",
    "A unit test typically follows the **Arrange\u2011Act\u2011Assert** pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arrange** \u2013 set up the objects and conditions for the test.\n",
    "- **Act** \u2013 execute the method or unit under test.\n",
    "- **Assert** \u2013 verify that the result matches expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple test for a `Calculator` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Calculator\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class CalculatorTests\n",
    "{\n",
    "    [Fact]\n",
    "    public void Add_ShouldReturnSumOfTwoNumbers()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Arrange\n",
    "        var calculator = new Calculator();\n",
    "        int a = 5;\n",
    "        int b = 3;\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Act\n",
    "        int result = calculator.Add(a, b);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Assert\n",
    "        Assert.Equal(8, result);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`[Fact]` marks a test method in xUnit. NUnit uses `[Test]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.4 Assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions are provided by the testing framework. xUnit includes many `Assert` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Assert.Equal(expected, actual)` \u2013 checks equality.\n",
    "- `Assert.NotEqual(expected, actual)`\n",
    "- `Assert.True(condition)`, `Assert.False(condition)`\n",
    "- `Assert.Null(object)`, `Assert.NotNull(object)`\n",
    "- `Assert.Throws<Exception>(() => ...)` \u2013 verifies that a specific exception is thrown.\n",
    "- `Assert.Contains(expectedSubstring, actualString)`\n",
    "- `Assert.Collection` \u2013 for verifying collections with multiple assertions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, testing exception throwing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[Fact]\n",
    "public void Deposit_NegativeAmount_ThrowsArgumentException()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    var account = new BankAccount();\n",
    "    Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => account.Deposit(-100));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.5 Mocking with Moq\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class depends on external components (e.g., databases, web services, file systems), you don't want to use the real implementations in unit tests. They would be slow, fragile, and test more than one unit. Instead, you create **mock objects** that simulate the behavior of dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moq** is the most popular mocking library. It allows you to create mock implementations of interfaces or classes (with virtual methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public interface IEmailSender\n",
    "{\n",
    "    void Send(string to, string subject);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class OrderService\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly IEmailSender _emailSender;\n",
    "    public OrderService(IEmailSender emailSender) => _emailSender = emailSender;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void PlaceOrder(Order order)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // ... business logic\n",
    "        _emailSender.Send(order.CustomerEmail, \"Order Confirmed\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To test `OrderService` without actually sending emails:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Moq;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class OrderServiceTests\n",
    "{\n",
    "    [Fact]\n",
    "    public void PlaceOrder_ShouldSendConfirmationEmail()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Arrange\n",
    "        var mockSender = new Mock<IEmailSender>();\n",
    "        var service = new OrderService(mockSender.Object);\n",
    "        var order = new Order { CustomerEmail = \"customer@example.com\" };\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Act\n",
    "        service.PlaceOrder(order);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Assert\n",
    "        mockSender.Verify(s => s.Send(\"customer@example.com\", \"Order Confirmed\"), Times.Once);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Mock<IEmailSender>` creates a mock.\n",
    "- `mockSender.Object` is the fake object that implements the interface.\n",
    "- `Verify` checks that the method was called with the expected arguments exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also set up mock behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "mockRepo.Setup(r => r.Get(It.IsAny<int>())).Returns(new Product { Id = 1, Name = \"Test\" });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.6 Testing Async Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing async methods is straightforward \u2013 the test method must be `async` and return `Task`. Use `await` to call the method under test.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class DataService\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public async Task<string> FetchDataAsync() => await Task.FromResult(\"data\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fact]\n",
    "public async Task FetchDataAsync_ShouldReturnData()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    var service = new DataService();\n",
    "    string result = await service.FetchDataAsync();\n",
    "    Assert.Equal(\"data\", result);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For mocking async methods, you can use `ReturnsAsync`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "mockRepo.Setup(r => r.GetAsync(1)).ReturnsAsync(new Product());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.7 Code Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "Code coverage measures how much of your production code is exercised by tests. While 100% coverage is not always necessary (and can be misleading), it's a useful metric to identify untested paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools like **Coverlet** (integrated with xUnit) and **dotnet test --collect:\"XPlat Code Coverage\"** can generate coverage reports. Visual Studio Enterprise has built\u2011in coverage tools, and there are third\u2011party services like Coveralls or Codecov.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aiming for high coverage on critical business logic is a good practice, but don't obsess over the percentage; focus on testing behavior, not lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.8 Best Practices for Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Test One Thing per Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Each test should verify a single behavior. If a test fails, you should know exactly what broke.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use Descriptive Names\n",
    "\n",
    "Test names should describe the scenario and expected outcome, e.g., `PlaceOrder_WithValidOrder_ShouldSaveToDatabase`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Keep Tests Independent\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests should not depend on each other or share state. Each test should be able to run alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Avoid Logic in Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests should be simple sequences of calls and assertions. Avoid `if` statements, loops, or complex logic that could itself be buggy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Use Mocks Only for External Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Mock interfaces or abstract classes that represent boundaries (I/O, services). For plain domain objects, use real instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Don't Mock What You Don't Own\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid mocking types you don't control (e.g., `DateTime.Now`). Instead, wrap them in a small interface you control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Write Tests Before Code (TDD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Test\u2011Driven Development (TDD) is a discipline where you write a failing test first, then implement just enough code to make it pass, then refactor. This ensures testability and high coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Keep Tests Fast\n",
    "\n",
    "Slow tests discourage frequent running. Aim for unit tests that execute in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Run Tests Frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrate tests into your build process (CI/CD). Run them locally before pushing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Treat Test Code with the Same Care as Production Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests need maintenance too. Keep them clean and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.9 Practical Example: Testing OrderService\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write comprehensive tests for the `OrderService` from Chapter 21, which depends on `IOrderRepository`, `IEmailSender`, and `ILogger`.\n",

    "- Each test focuses on one aspect.\n",
    "- We use `Verify` to check that methods were called.\n",
    "- For `PlaceOrder_ShouldAssignNewId`, we capture the saved order to inspect it.\n",
    "- For `GetOrder` tests, we set up the mock repository to return specific values.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.10 Integration Testing vs. Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "While unit tests isolate a single class, **integration tests** verify that multiple components work together correctly. They might use a real database, a test web server, or actual file I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ASP.NET Core, you can write integration tests using `WebApplicationFactory<T>` to spin up an in\u2011memory test server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration tests are slower and more brittle, so they should be used sparingly, primarily for critical paths and to catch issues that unit tests miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple integration test for our Notes API might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class NotesApiTests : IClassFixture<WebApplicationFactory<Program>>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly HttpClient _client;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public NotesApiTests(WebApplicationFactory<Program> factory)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _client = factory.CreateClient();\n",
    "    }\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tests the entire stack (routing, controllers, EF Core) but uses a real HTTP client. You can also replace the database with an in\u2011memory SQLite database for isolation.\n",

    "## 23.11 Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you've learned how to write unit tests that ensure your code behaves as expected:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unit testing** verifies individual units of code in isolation.\n",
    "- **xUnit** is the recommended testing framework.\n",
    "- Tests follow **Arrange\u2011Act\u2011Assert**.\n",
    "- **Assertions** verify outcomes.\n",
    "- **Moq** creates mocks to replace real dependencies.\n",
    "- **Code coverage** helps identify untested code.\n",
    "- **Best practices** keep tests maintainable and effective.\n",
    "- A practical example tested the `OrderService` thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit testing is an essential skill for professional developers. It not only catches bugs but also guides design and documents behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, **Concurrency and Parallelism**, you'll explore how to write multi\u2011threaded code safely and efficiently, handling tasks that run simultaneously, avoiding race conditions and deadlocks, and using the Task Parallel Library (TPL).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write unit tests for the `BankAccount` class from Chapter 11. Test deposit, withdrawal, and that exceptions are thrown for invalid amounts.\n",
    "2. For the Notes API from Chapter 22, write unit tests for the `NotesController` using mocks for `AppDbContext` (you'll need to mock `DbSet<T>` \u2013 this is more advanced; you can use an in\u2011memory database or a mocking library like `EntityFrameworkCore.Testing`).\n",
    "3. Practice TDD: Write a test for a new feature (e.g., a method that calculates discounts) before implementing it.\n",
    "4. Use Moq to verify that a method was **not** called under certain conditions (use `Times.Never`).\n",
    "5. Set up code coverage in your project using Coverlet and generate a report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, get ready to tackle concurrency in Chapter 24!"
