    "# Chapter 22: Building Web Applications with ASP.NET Core\n",
    "\n",
    "ASP.NET Core is a cross\u2011platform, high\u2011performance framework for building modern, cloud\u2011based, internet\u2011connected applications. Whether you're building a small REST API, a large e\u2011commerce site, or a real\u2011time web application, ASP.NET Core provides the tools and libraries you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The architecture of ASP.NET Core and its key components.\n",
    "- The two main approaches: **Minimal APIs** (simple, lightweight) and **MVC** (Model\u2011View\u2011Controller) for more structured applications.\n",
    "- How to define **routing** to map URLs to code.\n",
    "- The **middleware pipeline** \u2013 how requests flow through your application.\n",
    "- **Controllers** and **actions** as the core of MVC.\n",
    "- **Model binding** and **validation** \u2013 how data from HTTP requests is automatically converted to .NET objects and validated.\n",
    "- Using **Entity Framework Core** (EF Core) for data access: code\u2011first migrations, querying, and saving data.\n",
    "- The deep integration of **dependency injection** in ASP.NET Core.\n",
    "- A practical example: building a complete REST API for a simple note\u2011taking application.\n",
    "- Best practices and common pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll be able to build robust, maintainable web applications and APIs using the most popular framework in the .NET ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 22.1 Introduction to ASP.NET Core\n",
    "\n",
    "ASP.NET Core is a redesign of the classic ASP.NET, built from the ground up to be modular, lightweight, and cross\u2011platform. It runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and can be hosted on IIS, Nginx, Apache, or as a self\u2011contained executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unified programming model** \u2013 you can build web UIs (Razor Pages, MVC) and web APIs using the same framework.\n",
    "- **Dependency injection** is built in \u2013 no need for external containers (though you can plug them in).\n",
    "- **Middleware** \u2013 a pipeline of components that handle requests and responses.\n",
    "- **Cross\u2011platform** \u2013 develop and deploy anywhere.\n",
    "- **High performance** \u2013 consistently ranked among the fastest web frameworks.\n",
    "- **Open source** \u2013 community contributions and transparent development.\n",

    "## 22.2 Project Templates and Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a new ASP.NET Core project, you can choose from several templates: Empty, Web API, Web Application (MVC), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a New Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the .NET CLI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet new webapi -n MyApi\n",
    "dotnet new mvc -n MyMvcApp\n",
    "dotnet new web -n MinimalApp   # Minimal API template\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Structure (for Web API)\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical Web API project has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Controllers/` \u2013 folder for API controllers.\n",
    "- `Program.cs` \u2013 the entry point and startup configuration.\n",
    "- `appsettings.json` \u2013 configuration files.\n",
    "- `Properties/launchSettings.json` \u2013 launch profiles for development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In .NET 6 and later, `Program.cs` is simplified with top\u2011level statements and a minimal setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 22.3 Minimal APIs vs. MVC\n",
    "\n",
    "ASP.NET Core offers two primary ways to build HTTP APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimal APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduced in .NET 6, Minimal APIs are ideal for small microservices and simple endpoints. They use a concise syntax without the overhead of controllers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n",
    "var app = builder.Build();\n",
    "\n",
    "app.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Hello World!\");\n",
    "app.MapGet(\"/products\", async (ProductDbContext db) => await db.Products.ToListAsync());\n",
    "app.MapPost(\"/products\", async (Product product, ProductDbContext db) =>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    db.Products.Add(product);\n",
    "    await db.SaveChangesAsync();\n",
    "    return Results.Created($\"/products/{product.Id}\", product);\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "app.Run();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimal APIs are great for simple scenarios, but as your application grows, you may want more structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MVC (Model\u2011View\u2011Controller)\n",
    "\n",
    "MVC is a mature pattern that separates your application into three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model** \u2013 represents the data and business logic.\n",
    "- **View** \u2013 the UI layer (for web pages, not APIs).\n",
    "- **Controller** \u2013 handles HTTP requests, works with the model, and returns responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For APIs, you typically use controllers without views (just returning data). Controllers provide features like model binding, validation, filters, and easier organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[ApiController]\n",
    "[Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\n",
    "public class ProductsController : ControllerBase\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly ProductDbContext _context;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public ProductsController(ProductDbContext context)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _context = context;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [HttpGet]\n",
    "    public async Task<ActionResult<List<Product>>> GetAll() => await _context.Products.ToListAsync();\n",
    "\n",
    "    [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\n",
    "    public async Task<ActionResult<Product>> Get(int id)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        var product = await _context.Products.FindAsync(id);\n",
    "        if (product == null) return NotFound();\n",
    "        return product;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [HttpPost]\n",
    "    public async Task<ActionResult<Product>> Create(Product product)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _context.Products.Add(product);\n",
    "        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\n",
    "        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(Get), new { id = product.Id }, product);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which one to choose? Minimal APIs for small projects or prototypes; MVC for larger, more structured applications where you need features like filters, model binding attributes, and better testability. Both are valid; you can even mix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 22.4 Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing is how ASP.NET Core matches incoming HTTP requests to a specific handler (a controller action or a minimal API endpoint).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convention\u2011based Routing (MVC)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define routes using attributes or convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attribute Routing (preferred):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\n",
    "public class ProductsController : ControllerBase\n",
    "{\n",
    "    [HttpGet]\n",
    "    public IActionResult GetAll() { ... }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\n",
    "    public IActionResult Get(int id) { ... }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `[controller]` token is replaced with the controller name (without \"Controller\"). So the route for `ProductsController` becomes `api/products`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conventional Routing** (defined in `Program.cs`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.MapControllerRoute(\n",
    "    name: \"default\",\n",
    "    pattern: \"{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Routing in Minimal APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Routes are defined directly on the endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.MapGet(\"/products/{id}\", async (int id, ProductDbContext db) => ...);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define route constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.MapGet(\"/products/{id:int}\", ...); // only integers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 22.5 Middleware Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Middleware are components that are assembled into a pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each middleware can perform work before and after the next middleware in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple middleware example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.Use(async (context, next) =>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Before the next middleware\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"Request received\");\n",
    "    await next();\n",
    "    // After the next middleware\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"Response sent\");\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Common built\u2011in middleware:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `UseRouting()` \u2013 enables routing.\n",
    "- `UseAuthentication()` \u2013 handles authentication.\n",
    "- `UseAuthorization()` \u2013 handles authorization.\n",
    "- `UseStaticFiles()` \u2013 serves static files.\n",
    "- `UseEndpoints()` \u2013 maps endpoints (controllers or minimal APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of middleware matters. For example, `UseAuthentication` must come before `UseAuthorization`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 22.6 Controllers and Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "In MVC, a controller is a class that inherits from `ControllerBase` (for APIs) or `Controller` (for MVC with views). Actions are public methods on the controller that respond to HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returning Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions can return various types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `IActionResult` or `ActionResult<T>` \u2013 allows returning status codes, content, etc.\n",
    "- Specific types \u2013 automatically wrapped in an `Ok` result.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[HttpGet]\n",
    "public ActionResult<List<Product>> GetAll() => _context.Products.ToList();\n",
    "\n",
    "[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\n",
    "public IActionResult Get(int id)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    var product = _context.Products.Find(id);\n",
    "    if (product == null) return NotFound();\n",
    "    return Ok(product);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `ActionResult<T>` gives you the benefits of both type safety and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes for Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, `[HttpPut]`, `[HttpDelete]` \u2013 specify the HTTP method.\n",
    "- `[Route]` \u2013 custom route for an action.\n",
    "- `[Authorize]` \u2013 requires authentication.\n",
    "- `[ApiController]` \u2013 enables API\u2011specific behaviors (automatic model validation, binding source inference, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 22.7 Model Binding and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model binding** automatically maps data from HTTP requests (query string, route data, form, body) to action method parameters or complex types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public IActionResult Get([FromQuery] int page, [FromRoute] int id) { ... }\n",
    "[HttpPost]\n",
    "public IActionResult Create([FromBody] Product product) { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With `[ApiController]`, complex parameters are automatically bound from the body, and simple types from route/query. You can override with attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation** is performed via data annotations on model classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Product\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public int Id { get; set; }\n",
    "    [Required]\n",
    "    [StringLength(100)]\n",
    "    public string Name { get; set; }\n",
    "    [Range(0.01, 10000)]\n",
    "    public decimal Price { get; set; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When `[ApiController]` is present, invalid models automatically trigger a `400 Bad Request` response with details.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 22.8 Entity Framework Core (EF Core)\n",
    "\n",
    "EF Core is the modern object\u2011relational mapper (ORM) for .NET. It allows you to work with a database using .NET objects, eliminating most of the data\u2011access plumbing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up EF Core\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the necessary NuGet packages:\n",

    "\n",
    "## 22.9 Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core\n",
    "\n",
    "ASP.NET Core has a built\u2011in DI container. Services are registered in `Program.cs` and then injected into controllers, middleware, or other services.\n",

    "## 22.11 Best Practices and Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Use `[ApiController]` and `ControllerBase`\n",
    "\n",
    "`[ApiController]` enables automatic model validation, binding source inference, and other helpful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Return Appropriate HTTP Status Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `Ok()`, `CreatedAtAction()`, `NoContent()`, `BadRequest()`, `NotFound()` consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Validate Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Use data annotations and check `ModelState.IsValid`. `[ApiController]` handles it automatically, but you can still customize.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use Dependency Injection for All Services\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid `new`\u2011ing up dependencies. Let the container handle lifetimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Keep Controllers Thin\n",
    "\n",
    "Controllers should only handle HTTP concerns. Move business logic to separate services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Use Async/Await for I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "Database calls, file operations, etc., should be async to avoid blocking threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Secure Your API\n",
    "\n",
    "Use HTTPS, authentication (e.g., JWT), and authorization. Apply `[Authorize]` attributes as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Version Your API\n",
    "\n",
    "As your API evolves, consider versioning to avoid breaking existing clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Log and Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `ILogger` to log important events, errors, and request information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Write Integration Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your API endpoints to ensure they behave correctly.\n",

    "## 22.12 Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you've built a solid foundation in ASP.NET Core web development:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimal APIs** and **MVC** \u2013 two ways to build APIs, each with its strengths.\n",
    "- **Routing** \u2013 how URLs map to code.\n",
    "- **Middleware pipeline** \u2013 the request/response processing chain.\n",
    "- **Controllers** and **actions** \u2013 the core of MVC.\n",
    "- **Model binding** and **validation** \u2013 automatically mapping and validating request data.\n",
    "- **Entity Framework Core** \u2013 data access with migrations and LINQ.\n",
    "- **Dependency injection** \u2013 integrated throughout the framework.\n",
    "- A complete **Notes API** example demonstrating all these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASP.NET Core is a vast topic, but this chapter gives you the essential knowledge to start building real\u2011world applications. As you continue, you'll explore areas like authentication, real\u2011time communication (SignalR), background tasks, and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, **Unit Testing for Quality Code**, you'll learn how to write automated tests to ensure your code works correctly and continues to do so as it evolves. You'll cover unit testing frameworks (xUnit, NUnit), mocking dependencies, and testing ASP.NET Core controllers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend the Notes API by adding a `User` entity and associating notes with users. Implement authentication using JWT.\n",
    "2. Add filtering and pagination to the `GET /api/notes` endpoint (e.g., `?page=1&pageSize=10`).\n",
    "3. Write a middleware that logs the time taken for each request.\n",
    "4. Convert the Notes API to use Minimal APIs instead of MVC. Compare the code size and organization.\n",
    "5. Deploy the API to a cloud platform like Azure App Service or a local Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, get ready to ensure code quality with unit testing in Chapter 23!"
