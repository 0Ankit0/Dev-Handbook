    "# Chapter 9: Inheritance & Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters, you learned how to create classes and objects, and how to control their initialization. Now we\u2019ll explore one of the most powerful concepts in object\u2011oriented programming: **inheritance**. Inheritance allows you to define a new class based on an existing class, reusing and extending its functionality. This leads to hierarchical classifications and code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closely related to inheritance is **polymorphism** \u2013 the ability of an object to take many forms. In C#, polymorphism enables you to write code that works with objects of a base class, but at runtime it can execute methods defined in derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to create **base classes** and **derived classes**.\n",
    "- The role of the `base` keyword.\n",
    "- How to override methods with `virtual` and `override`.\n",
    "- The use of **abstract classes** and **abstract methods**.\n",
    "- How to prevent further inheritance with `sealed`.\n",
    "- How polymorphism makes your code flexible and extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you\u2019ll be able to design class hierarchies that model real\u2011world relationships and write code that adapts to different object types.\n",

    "## 9.1 Base Classes and Derived Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance models an **\u201cis\u2011a\u201d** relationship. For example, a `Car` is a `Vehicle`, a `Dog` is an `Animal`. The more general class is the **base class** (or parent class), and the more specific class is the **derived class** (or child class).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Base Class\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Vehicle\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string Make { get; set; }\n",
    "    public string Model { get; set; }\n",
    "    public int Year { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void Start()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Vehicle is starting...\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Derived Class\n",
    "\n",
    "You specify the base class using a colon (`:`) after the derived class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Car : Vehicle\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public int NumberOfDoors { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void Honk()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Beep beep!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now a `Car` has all the members of `Vehicle` plus its own:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Car myCar = new Car();\n",
    "myCar.Make = \"Toyota\";      // from Vehicle\n",
    "myCar.Model = \"Corolla\";    // from Vehicle\n",
    "myCar.Year = 2022;          // from Vehicle\n",
    "myCar.NumberOfDoors = 4;    // from Car\n",
    "myCar.Start();               // from Vehicle\n",
    "myCar.Honk();                // from Car\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `base` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside a derived class, you can access members of the base class using the `base` keyword. This is especially useful when you want to call a base class constructor or a method that has been overridden.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Car : Vehicle\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public Car(string make, string model, int year, int doors) \n",
    "        : base() // calls base class constructor (implicitly even if omitted)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Alternatively, you can call a base constructor with parameters\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void ShowDetails()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        base.Start(); // explicitly calling base method (optional)\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine($\"Car: {Make} {Model}, {Year} with {NumberOfDoors} doors\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the base class has a parameterized constructor, you must call it explicitly using `base(...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Vehicle\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public Vehicle(string make)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Make = make;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Car : Vehicle\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public Car(string make, string model) : base(make)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Model = model;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance and Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an instance of a derived class, the base class constructor is called first (either implicitly the default constructor, or the one you specify with `base`). This ensures that the base part of the object is initialized before the derived part.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.2 Virtual and Override Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, methods in a base class are **not** overridable. If you want to allow a derived class to provide its own implementation, you mark the base method as `virtual`. The derived class then uses `override` to replace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Vehicle\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public virtual void Start()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Vehicle is starting...\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Car : Vehicle\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public override void Start()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Car engine roars to life!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you call `Start` on a `Car` object, the overridden version runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Vehicle myVehicle = new Car(); // a Car stored in a Vehicle variable\n",
    "myVehicle.Start(); // Output: \"Car engine roars to life!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Override vs. New\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't use `override`, but instead use the `new` keyword, you hide the base method. This is rarely needed and can lead to confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Car : Vehicle\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public new void Start() // hides the base method\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Car start (hiding)\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With hiding, the method called depends on the compile\u2011time type, not the runtime type. This breaks polymorphism, so use `override` unless you have a specific reason not to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling Base Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to extend the base behavior, not replace it entirely. You can call the base method using `base.MethodName()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Car : Vehicle\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public override void Start()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        base.Start(); // first do what the base does\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Car specific startup complete.\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.3 Abstract Classes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to define a base class that should never be instantiated \u2013 it\u2019s too general. Such a class is called an **abstract class**. You mark it with the `abstract` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class can have **abstract methods** \u2013 methods that have no implementation in the base class but must be implemented by derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public abstract class Shape\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public abstract double GetArea(); // no body, just a signature\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void Display()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine($\"Area: {GetArea()}\");\n",
    "    }\n",

    "public class Circle : Shape\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public double Radius { get; set; }\n",

    "    public override double GetArea()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You cannot create an instance of an abstract class (`new Shape()` is illegal).\n",
    "- Any non\u2011abstract derived class must provide implementations for all abstract members.\n",
    "- Abstract methods are implicitly virtual \u2013 they must be overridden.\n",
    "- An abstract class can have non\u2011abstract (concrete) members as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes are perfect for defining a common contract and shared functionality that derived classes can build upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.4 Sealed Classes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to prevent further inheritance, mark a class as `sealed`. No class can derive from a sealed class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public sealed class FinalClass\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// This causes a compiler error\n",
    "// public class Derived : FinalClass { }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also seal an individual `override` method to prevent it from being overridden further down the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Animal\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public virtual void Speak() { }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Dog : Animal\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public sealed override void Speak()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(\"Woof!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Puppy : Dog\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Cannot override Speak because it's sealed in Dog\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sealing is a design decision: it locks the behavior and can sometimes improve performance (since the runtime knows the method won\u2019t be overridden). Use it when you want to finalize an implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.5 Polymorphism in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism** means \u201cmany forms.\u201d In C#, it allows you to treat objects of derived classes as objects of the base class, and at runtime the correct overridden methods are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Animal\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public virtual void MakeSound() => Console.WriteLine(\"Some sound\");\n",

    "{\n",
    "    public override void MakeSound() => Console.WriteLine(\"Meow!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "Animal myDog = new Dog();\n",
    "Animal myCat = new Cat();\n",
    "\n",
    "myDog.MakeSound(); // Woof!\n",
    "myCat.MakeSound(); // Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the variables are of type `Animal`, the actual object type determines which `MakeSound` runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphic Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a collection of the base type and store any derived objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "List<Animal> animals = new List<Animal>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    new Dog(),\n",
    "    new Cat(),\n",
    "    new Dog()\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "foreach (Animal a in animals)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    a.MakeSound(); // each animal makes its own sound\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Employee` is an **abstract class** with an abstract method `CalculateMonthlyPay`. It also has a virtual method `DisplayInfo` that can be overridden.\n",
    "- `SalariedEmployee`, `HourlyEmployee`, and `CommissionEmployee` derive from `Employee` and implement `CalculateMonthlyPay` (and optionally override `DisplayInfo`).\n",
    "- In `Main`, we store different employee types in a `List<Employee>` \u2013 this is polymorphism.\n",
    "- Iterating over the list, we call `DisplayInfo` and `CalculateMonthlyPay`. Each object behaves according to its actual type.\n",
    "- We also show how to check the runtime type using `is` and pattern matching to access type\u2011specific members (like `HoursWorked` for hourly employees).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates how inheritance and polymorphism lead to clean, extensible code. Adding a new employee type (e.g., `InternEmployee`) would require no changes to the processing loop \u2013 just define the new class and it will work.\n",

    "## 9.7 Common Pitfalls and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Favor Composition Over Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every relationship should be modeled with inheritance. If the relationship is \u201chas\u2011a\u201d rather than \u201cis\u2011a\u201d, use composition (embedding an object as a field). Inheritance creates tight coupling; composition is more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use `virtual` Judiciously\n",
    "\n",
    "Mark methods as `virtual` only when you intend them to be overridden. By default, methods should be non\u2011virtual to avoid unintended changes in behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Follow the Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes without breaking the program. That means:\n",
    "- Don\u2019t strengthen preconditions (e.g., require more than the base method).\n",
    "- Don\u2019t weaken postconditions (e.g., return a narrower range).\n",
    "- Preserve the base class invariants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violating this principle leads to brittle code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Seal Classes Unless Designed for Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven\u2019t designed a class to be inherited from, consider marking it `sealed`. This prevents others from deriving from it in ways you didn\u2019t anticipate, which could introduce bugs. The .NET framework does this for many classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Use Abstract Classes for Shared State and Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes are useful when you have a common base with some implemented methods and fields that derived classes should share. If you only need a contract, consider using an interface instead (Chapter 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Call Base Methods When Overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "If you override a method, decide whether you need to call the base implementation. Forgetting to call it might skip essential base logic. Conversely, calling it when not needed can cause unintended side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Avoid Deep Inheritance Hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep hierarchies are hard to understand and maintain. Aim for shallow, focused hierarchies. If you find yourself needing many levels, reconsider your design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Use `sealed` on Overrides When Appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to allow overriding in one derived class but prevent further overriding, seal that override. This locks the behavior at that level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Constructor in Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that base class constructors are called first. If the base class doesn\u2019t have a parameterless constructor, derived classes must explicitly call a base constructor using `base(...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Prefer Pattern Matching Over `as` and Casts\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "HourlyEmployee h = emp as HourlyEmployee;\n",
    "if (h != null) { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pattern matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "if (emp is HourlyEmployee hourly) { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It\u2019s cleaner and safer.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 9.8 Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you\u2019ve mastered the core OOP concepts of inheritance and polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance** allows you to create derived classes that extend base classes, reusing code and establishing \u201cis\u2011a\u201d relationships.\n",
    "- The **`base` keyword** lets you access base class members and call base constructors.\n",
    "- **Virtual and override** methods enable derived classes to provide their own implementations while preserving polymorphic behavior.\n",
    "- **Abstract classes and methods** define a contract that derived classes must fulfill, and prevent instantiation of the base class.\n",
    "- **Sealed classes and methods** stop further inheritance or overriding.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism** lets you treat objects of derived types as base type objects, with method calls resolved at runtime based on the actual object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are fundamental to designing flexible, maintainable object\u2011oriented systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, **Interfaces \u2013 Defining Contracts**, you\u2019ll learn about interfaces, which are similar to abstract classes but with multiple inheritance capabilities and a pure contract focus. Interfaces are widely used in C# to achieve loose coupling and enable powerful design patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a base class `Animal` with a virtual method `MakeSound()`. Derive `Dog` and `Cat` classes that override it. Write a program that stores a list of animals and makes each sound.\n",
    "2. Design an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `GetArea()`. Implement `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` derived classes. Test polymorphism by iterating through a list of shapes.\n",
    "3. Add a `sealed` class `FinalShape` that derives from `Rectangle` and try to derive from it \u2013 see the compiler error.\n",
    "4. In the employee example, add a new employee type `InternEmployee` that has a fixed stipend. Add it to the list and see how the existing code handles it without changes.\n",
    "5. Experiment with calling base methods in overrides. Create a base method that logs something, override it in a derived class, and call `base.Method()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, get ready to dive into interfaces in Chapter 10!"
