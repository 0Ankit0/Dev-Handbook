    "# Chapter 6: Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the heart of C# programming! So far, we\u2019ve been working with primitive data types, collections, and methods. But real\u2011world applications are built by modeling real\u2011world entities: a customer, an invoice, a bank account, a game character. In C#, we model these entities using **classes** and **objects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior (data and methods) that the objects of that class will have. An **object** is an instance of a class \u2013 a concrete entity created from that blueprint.\n",

    "- How to define a class with **fields**, **properties**, and **methods**.\n",
    "- How to create objects using the `new` keyword.\n",
    "- The difference between **static** and instance members.\n",
    "- How to control access to class members with **access modifiers** (`public`, `private`, `internal`, `protected`).\n",
    "- The role of the `this` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these concepts is the foundation of **object\u2011oriented programming (OOP)**, which helps you write code that is modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",

    "## 6.1 Defining a Class: Fields, Properties, and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by a name (by convention, PascalCase) and a pair of curly braces containing its members.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Simple Class\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Fields (data)\n",
    "    public string Name;\n",
    "    public int Age;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Method (behavior)\n",
    "    public void Introduce()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine($\"Hi, I'm {Name} and I'm {Age} years old.\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `Person` class has two **fields** (`Name` and `Age`) and one **method** (`Introduce`). Fields store the state of an object; methods define its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields are variables declared directly inside a class. They hold the data for an object. By convention, fields are usually `private` (we\u2019ll discuss access modifiers soon) and are named with camelCase. If they are `public`, they are named with PascalCase, but exposing public fields is generally discouraged because it breaks encapsulation. Instead, we use **properties**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties are members that provide a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the values of private fields. They look like fields from the outside but internally can contain logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Auto\u2011Implemented Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form is an **auto\u2011implemented property**, where the compiler generates a hidden backing field for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string Name { get; set; }\n",
    "    public int Age { get; set; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `Name` and `Age` are properties. You can get and set their values just like fields, but behind the scenes they use accessors (`get` and `set`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Full Property Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need validation or additional logic, you can provide a full property implementation with an explicit backing field.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private string _name;\n",
    "    private int _age;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public string Name\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        get { return _name; }\n",
    "        set \n",
    "        { \n",
    "            if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value))\n",
    "                throw new ArgumentException(\"Name cannot be empty\");\n",
    "            _name = value; \n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public int Age\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        get { return _age; }\n",
    "        set \n",
    "        { \n",
    "            if (value < 0 || value > 150)\n",
    "                throw new ArgumentException(\"Age must be between 0 and 150\");\n",
    "            _age = value; \n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have control over what values are assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Read\u2011Only and Write\u2011Only Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "You can omit the `set` accessor to create a read\u2011only property, or omit the `get` for a write\u2011only property (though write\u2011only is rare).\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private DateTime _birthDate;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Person(DateTime birthDate)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _birthDate = birthDate;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public int Age\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        get\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            int age = DateTime.Now.Year - _birthDate.Year;\n",
    "            if (DateTime.Now < _birthDate.AddYears(age)) age--;\n",
    "            return age;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `Age` is computed from `_birthDate` and has no `set` \u2013 it\u2019s read\u2011only.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods define the actions an object can perform. They can use the object\u2019s fields and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string Name { get; set; }\n",
    "    public int Age { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void Introduce()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine($\"Hi, I'm {Name} and I'm {Age} years old.\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public bool IsAdult()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        return Age >= 18;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods can also take parameters and return values, as you learned in Chapter 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Objects and Instances: The `new` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is just a blueprint. To create an actual object (an instance) that exists in memory, you use the `new` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Person person1 = new Person();  // create a new Person object\n",
    "person1.Name = \"Alice\";\n",
    "person1.Age = 30;\n",
    "person1.Introduce();            // calls the method on that object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create multiple independent instances:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Person person2 = new Person();\n",
    "person2.Name = \"Bob\";\n",
    "person2.Age = 25;\n",
    "person2.Introduce();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object has its own copy of the instance fields, so changing `person1.Name` does not affect `person2.Name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Initializers\n",
    "\n",
    "C# provides a concise syntax to set properties at the time of creation using **object initializers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Person person = new Person { Name = \"Charlie\", Age = 35 };\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to creating the object and then assigning the properties, but it\u2019s more readable and can be used in expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `new` Keyword and Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write `new Person()`, you\u2019re calling a special method called a **constructor**. If you don\u2019t define any constructors, the compiler provides a default parameterless constructor that initializes fields to their default values (e.g., `null` for reference types, `0` for numeric types). We\u2019ll dive deep into constructors in Chapter 8, but for now, know that you can also define your own constructors to require certain values when creating an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string Name { get; set; }\n",
    "    public int Age { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Custom constructor\n",
    "    public Person(string name, int age)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Name = name;\n",
    "        Age = age;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "Person person = new Person(\"Diana\", 28);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With a custom constructor, you can no longer use the default parameterless constructor unless you explicitly add one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3 The `static` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all members belong to an instance. Some members belong to the **class itself** \u2013 they are shared across all instances. These are marked with the `static` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "A static field holds a value that is shared by all objects of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Counter\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static int TotalCount = 0;  // shared counter\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Counter()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        TotalCount++;  // increment whenever a new instance is created\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "Counter c1 = new Counter();\n",
    "Counter c2 = new Counter();\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(Counter.TotalCount); // 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Static fields are accessed using the class name, not an instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A static method can be called without creating an instance. It cannot access instance members directly (because there is no `this` reference), but it can access other static members.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class MathUtilities\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static int Add(int a, int b)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        return a + b;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "int result = MathUtilities.Add(5, 3); // called on the class, not an object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ve already used many static methods, like `Console.WriteLine` and `int.Parse`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A class can be declared `static`. Such a class cannot be instantiated, and can only contain static members. It\u2019s typically used for utility classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public static class FileHelper\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static void DeleteFile(string path)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // implementation\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot create an instance of `FileHelper`; you just call its static methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `using static` Directive\n",
    "\n",
    "C# 6 introduced the `using static` directive, which allows you to import the static members of a class so you can use them without the class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using static System.Console;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Program\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static void Main()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");  // instead of Console.WriteLine\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This can make code more concise, but use it judiciously to avoid confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.4 Access Modifiers: Controlling Visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Access modifiers determine which parts of your code can see and use a class member. They are fundamental to **encapsulation** \u2013 hiding internal details and exposing only what\u2019s necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "C# provides several access modifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Modifier      | Description |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| `public`      | Accessible from any code. |\n",
    "| `private`     | Accessible only within the same class. |\n",
    "| `internal`    | Accessible only within the same assembly (project). |\n",
    "| `protected`   | Accessible within the same class and derived classes. |\n",
    "| `protected internal` | Accessible within the same assembly or derived classes. |\n",
    "| `private protected` | Accessible within the same class or derived classes, but only if in the same assembly. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying Access Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, class members are `private` if you don\u2019t specify an access modifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class BankAccount\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private decimal _balance;           // only accessible inside this class\n",
    "\n",
    "    public decimal Balance               // public property to expose balance safely\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        get { return _balance; }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void Deposit(decimal amount)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if (amount <= 0)\n",
    "            throw new ArgumentException(\"Amount must be positive\");\n",
    "        _balance += amount;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if (amount <= 0)\n",
    "            throw new ArgumentException(\"Amount must be positive\");\n",
    "        if (amount > _balance)\n",
    "            throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Insufficient funds\");\n",
    "        _balance -= amount;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `_balance` is `private` \u2013 it cannot be directly changed from outside. The public methods `Deposit` and `Withdraw` enforce business rules, and the public property `Balance` allows read\u2011only access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Encapsulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation protects the integrity of an object\u2019s data. By hiding internal fields and providing controlled access through methods and properties, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validate data before assigning.\n",
    "- Change internal implementation without affecting external code.\n",
    "- Ensure the object is always in a valid state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Modifiers for Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Top\u2011level classes (not nested) can only be `public` or `internal`. By default, they are `internal`. If you want a class to be usable from other assemblies, you mark it `public`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.5 The `this` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside an instance method or property, the `this` keyword refers to the current object. It\u2019s used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distinguish between class members and parameters with the same name.\n",
    "- Pass the current object as a parameter to another method.\n",
    "- Call another constructor from a constructor (constructor chaining \u2013 we\u2019ll see in Chapter 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private string name;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Person(string name)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        this.name = name;  // this.name refers to the field, name is the parameter\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void Print()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine(this.name); // 'this' is optional here\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Person GetOlder()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // return this object (allows method chaining)\n",
    "        return this;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static field** `_lastAccountNumber` is shared across all instances, used to generate unique account numbers.\n",
    "- **Private fields** `_accountNumber`, `_balance`, `_transactionHistory` hold internal state.\n",
    "- **Read\u2011only properties** expose account number and balance safely. The transaction history is exposed as `IReadOnlyList<string>` to prevent external modification.\n",
    "- **Constructor** validates parameters and initializes fields. It calls a static method to generate an account number.\n",
    "- **Public methods** `Deposit` and `Withdraw` change the balance and add transaction records. They contain business rules (no negative amounts, sufficient funds).\n",
    "- **Private helper method** `AddTransaction` encapsulates the logic of adding a transaction entry.\n",
    "- **Static method** `DisplayBankInfo` shows bank\u2011level information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates real\u2011world encapsulation: the internal data is protected, and the object\u2019s behavior is controlled through well\u2011defined methods.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6.7 Common Pitfalls and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Prefer Properties Over Public Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Public fields break encapsulation because you cannot add validation or change the internal representation later. Always use properties (auto\u2011implemented or full) for public data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Keep Fields Private\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields should almost always be `private`. If you need to expose data, use a property. If you need to expose a field to derived classes, consider `protected`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use Auto\u2011Implemented Properties for Simple Data\n",
    "\n",
    "When you don\u2019t need validation logic, auto\u2011implemented properties are concise and clear. You can later change them to full properties without breaking callers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Initialize Fields and Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that objects are created in a valid state. Use constructors to enforce required data. For optional data, you can use object initializers or set defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Understand When to Use `static`\n",
    "\n",
    "Static members are useful for utility methods, factory methods, or shared data. However, overusing static can make code hard to test and inflexible. Use static judiciously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Use `readonly` for Immutable Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "If a field should be set only once (in the constructor) and never changed, mark it `readonly`. This expresses intent and prevents accidental modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly DateTime _birthDate;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Person(DateTime birthDate)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _birthDate = birthDate;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Follow Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `BankAccount`)\n",
    "- Public members (fields, properties, methods): PascalCase (e.g., `Deposit`)\n",
    "- Private fields: `_camelCase` (e.g., `_balance`)\n",
    "- Parameters and local variables: camelCase (e.g., `amount`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent naming makes code more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Keep Classes Focused\n",
    "\n",
    "A class should have a single responsibility. If a class does too much, consider splitting it into smaller, more focused classes. This is the **Single Responsibility Principle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Use Expression\u2011Bodied Members Where Appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple methods and properties can be written concisely with `=>`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public string FullName => $\"{FirstName} {LastName}\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.8 Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you\u2019ve taken your first major step into object\u2011oriented programming with C#:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You learned how to define a class with **fields**, **properties**, and **methods**.\n",
    "- You created objects using the `new` keyword and object initializers.\n",
    "- You understood the difference between **static** and instance members, and how to use static classes and the `using static` directive.\n",
    "- You explored **access modifiers** to control visibility and enforce encapsulation.\n",
    "- You saw how the `this` keyword refers to the current object.\n",
    "- You examined a complete, practical example that brings all these concepts together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and objects are the foundation of virtually all C# applications. Mastering them is essential for building well\u2011structured, maintainable software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, **Properties, Indexers, and Records**, we\u2019ll dive deeper into properties (including computed properties), learn about indexers that let your objects behave like arrays, and explore **records** \u2013 a special kind of class introduced in C# 9 for immutable data objects. You\u2019ll see how these features make your code more expressive and robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a class `Book` with properties `Title`, `Author`, `ISBN`, and `Price`. Ensure `Price` cannot be negative. Add a method `GetDisplayText()` that returns a formatted string.\n",
    "2. Create a `Library` class that contains a list of `Book` objects. Add methods to add a book, remove a book by ISBN, and find books by author.\n",
    "3. Add a static field to `Book` that counts how many book objects have been created. Expose it via a static property.\n",
    "4. Create a `Temperature` class that stores the temperature in Celsius internally, but provides properties to get and set in Fahrenheit and Kelvin (with conversion logic).\n",
    "5. Experiment with access modifiers: create a class with a mix of `public`, `private`, `protected` members and try to access them from another class in the same project and from a derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, get ready to enhance your classes with more powerful features in Chapter 7!"
