    "# Chapter 7: Properties, Indexers, and Records\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 6, you learned how to define classes with fields and methods, and you saw the importance of encapsulation. Now we\u2019ll dive deeper into three C# features that make encapsulation more powerful and expressive: **properties**, **indexers**, and **records**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties allow you to expose data with control, hiding implementation details while providing a field\u2011like syntax. Indexers let your objects behave like arrays, enabling you to access elements by index or key. Records, introduced in C# 9, are a special kind of class designed for immutable data and value\u2011based equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you\u2019ll be able to design classes that are both safe and intuitive to use.\n",

    "## 7.1 Properties Revisited \u2013 Auto\u2011Implemented and Full Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw in Chapter 6, properties are members that provide a flexible way to read, write, or compute the values of private fields. They consist of `get` and `set` accessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auto\u2011Implemented Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form is the **auto\u2011implemented property**, where the compiler generates a hidden backing field for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string Name { get; set; }\n",
    "    public int Age { get; set; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is concise and perfect when you don\u2019t need validation or additional logic. The backing field is not accessible directly; you always go through the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Property Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need validation, change notification, or computed behavior, you can provide a full implementation with an explicit backing field.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "private string _name;\n",
    "public string Name\n",
    "{\n",
    "    get { return _name; }\n",
    "    set\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value))\n",
    "            throw new ArgumentException(\"Name cannot be empty\");\n",
    "        _name = value;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computed Properties (Read\u2011Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "A property can have only a `get` accessor, making it read\u2011only. Its value is typically computed from other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Rectangle\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public double Width { get; set; }\n",
    "    public double Height { get; set; }\n",
    "    public double Area => Width * Height; // expression\u2011bodied property\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `Area` is computed on the fly; there is no backing field. Such a property is often called a **computed property** or **derived property**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property Access Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply access modifiers to the `get` or `set` accessors individually, allowing finer control. For example, you might want a public getter but a private setter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string Name { get; private set; } // can be set only inside the class\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Person(string name)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Name = name; // allowed because we're inside the class\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `init` accessor (C# 9) is a special setter that can only be called during object initialization \u2013 either in a constructor or an object initializer. After that, the property becomes read\u2011only.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string Name { get; init; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "var p = new Person { Name = \"Alice\" }; // OK\n",
    "p.Name = \"Bob\"; // Compiler error \u2013 init\u2011only property cannot be set after initialization\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is perfect for creating immutable objects without writing a full constructor for every property.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.2 Indexers\n",
    "\n",
    "An **indexer** allows an object to be indexed like an array. You define an indexer using the `this` keyword followed by a parameter list in square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Indexer Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a class that represents a collection of temperatures:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class TempRecord\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private float[] temps = new float[10] { 56.2F, 56.7F, 56.5F, 57.1F, 57.3F, 57.6F, 57.8F, 58.0F, 58.2F, 58.5F };\n",
    "\n",
    "    public float this[int index]\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        get => temps[index];\n",
    "        set => temps[index] = value;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now use it like an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "TempRecord record = new TempRecord();\n",
    "record[3] = 58.1F;\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(record[3]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexers with Different Parameter Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexers aren\u2019t limited to integers. You can use any type, such as a string, to create a dictionary\u2011like behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class DayTemperatures\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private Dictionary<string, float> temps = new Dictionary<string, float>();\n",
    "\n",
    "    public float this[string day]\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        get => temps.ContainsKey(day) ? temps[day] : throw new KeyNotFoundException();\n",
    "        set => temps[day] = value;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "DayTemperatures week = new DayTemperatures();\n",
    "week[\"Monday\"] = 72.5F;\n",
    "week[\"Tuesday\"] = 74.0F;\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(week[\"Monday\"]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overloading Indexers\n",
    "\n",
    "A class can have multiple indexers as long as their parameter lists differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class MultiIndex\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string this[int i] => \"int index\";\n",
    "    public string this[string s] => \"string index\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexers in Real\u2011World Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Many .NET collections use indexers: `List<T>` has an integer indexer, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` has a key\u2011based indexer. When you create your own collection\u2011like classes, indexers make them intuitive to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.3 Records \u2013 Immutable Data Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Records** are a reference type (like a class) introduced in C# 9 that provides built\u2011in functionality for immutable data and value\u2011based equality. They are ideal for DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), API responses, and any situation where you want objects that are primarily about data and shouldn\u2019t change after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring a Record\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to declare a record is with the `record` keyword and a positional syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This single line creates a record with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two public **init\u2011only properties** `FirstName` and `LastName`.\n",
    "- A primary constructor that sets those properties.\n",
    "- Deconstruct method for pattern matching.\n",
    "- Value\u2011based equality members (`Equals`, `GetHashCode`, `==`, `!=`).\n",
    "- A nice `ToString()` implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var person1 = new Person(\"Alice\", \"Smith\");\n",
    "var person2 = new Person(\"Alice\", \"Smith\");\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(person1); // Person { FirstName = Alice, LastName = Smith }\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(person1 == person2); // True (value equality)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Record Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also write a record with a more traditional class\u2011like syntax, giving you full control:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public record Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string FirstName { get; init; }\n",
    "    public string LastName { get; init; }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Person(string firstName, string lastName)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        FirstName = firstName;\n",
    "        LastName = lastName;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But the positional syntax is much more concise for simple data containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `with` Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Records support non\u2011destructive mutation via the `with` expression, which creates a new record instance with some properties changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var original = new Person(\"Alice\", \"Smith\");\n",
    "var modified = original with { LastName = \"Jones\" };\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(original); // Person { FirstName = Alice, LastName = Smith }\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(modified); // Person { FirstName = Alice, LastName = Jones }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The original remains unchanged \u2013 perfect for immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value\u2011Based Equality\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classes, which use reference equality by default, records use **value equality**: two records are equal if all their properties are equal. This is implemented by the compiler overriding `Equals`, `GetHashCode`, and the `==` and `!=` operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var a = new Person(\"Alice\", \"Smith\");\n",
    "var b = new Person(\"Alice\", \"Smith\");\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(a == b); // True\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(ReferenceEquals(a, b)); // False (they are different objects)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Records vs. Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **records** when your object is primarily a container for data that should be immutable and compared by value (e.g., configuration, DTOs, events).\n",
    "- Use **classes** when your object has identity, mutable state, or complex behavior (e.g., entities in a domain model, services).\n",
    "\n",
    "Records can also be mutable if you use `set` instead of `init`, but that defeats their purpose. Stick to immutability for records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Records Can Have Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Records aren\u2019t just data bags; they can contain methods, properties, and even other members. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string FullName => $\"{FirstName} {LastName}\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance with Records\n",
    "\n",
    "Records can inherit from other records, but not from classes (and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public record Employee(string FirstName, string LastName, string Department) \n",
    "    : Person(FirstName, LastName);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Equality and `with` expressions work correctly with inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Book` is a **record** with init\u2011only properties, validation in the constructor, and a computed property `DisplayName`.\n",
    "- `Library` is a class that contains a private list of books. It exposes a read\u2011only list via a property, ensuring external code cannot modify the collection directly (though the books themselves are immutable records).\n",
    "- Two **indexers** are defined: one by ISBN (string) and one by position (int). This makes the library intuitive to use.\n",
    "- Methods `AddBook`, `RemoveBook`, and `FindByAuthor` provide controlled manipulation.\n",
    "- The `Main` method demonstrates all features, including the `with` expression to create a modified copy of a record, and value\u2011based equality of records.\n",

    "## 7.5 Common Pitfalls and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Prefer Auto\u2011Properties for Simple Data\n",
    "\n",
    "If a property has no logic, use auto\u2011implemented properties. They are concise and expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use Computed Properties Instead of Methods for Simple Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "If a value can be derived from existing data and the calculation is lightweight, a computed property is more natural than a method (e.g., `Area` vs. `CalculateArea()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Make Properties Read\u2011Only When Appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "If a property should not change after object creation, use `get; init;` (for records) or `get; private set;` (for classes) to enforce immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use Indexers for Collection\u2011Like Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "If your class represents a collection of items, provide an indexer to make it feel like a native array or list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Keep Indexers Simple\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexers should be straightforward and not perform heavy computation. If an indexer might throw, document it clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Favor Records for Immutable Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Records reduce boilerplate and give you value equality for free. Use them whenever you need simple data containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Be Aware of Record Equality Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "Record equality compares all properties. If you have properties that shouldn\u2019t be part of equality (e.g., a cached value), you might need to override equality members manually (rare).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Use `with` Expressions Safely\n",
    "\n",
    "`with` creates a shallow copy. If your record contains reference types (other than strings), the copy shares references to the same objects. For deep immutability, consider using records for nested data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Validate Data in Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with init\u2011only properties, you can (and should) validate in the constructor to ensure objects are always in a valid state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Name Indexers Clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "Although indexers use `this`, the class name itself should convey what the indexer does. For example, a `Library` class with an indexer by ISBN is clear.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 7.6 Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you expanded your knowledge of C# types with three powerful features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Properties** \u2013 you revisited auto\u2011implemented and full properties, learned about computed properties, and saw how to control access with `init` and private setters.\n",
    "- **Indexers** \u2013 you discovered how to make your classes indexable, with parameters of any type, and how they improve usability for collection\u2011like classes.\n",
    "- **Records** \u2013 you explored the modern way to define immutable data objects, with built\u2011in value equality and non\u2011destructive mutation via `with` expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these tools enable you to design classes that are both robust and pleasant to use. They are widely used in modern C# development, especially in scenarios involving data transfer, configuration, and API design.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, **Constructors & Object Initialization**, we\u2019ll dive deep into how objects come to life. You\u2019ll learn about different types of constructors, constructor chaining, object initializers, and the `required` modifier (C# 11). These concepts will give you fine\u2011grained control over how objects are created and initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `Student` record with properties `FirstName`, `LastName`, `StudentId`, and `GPA`. Ensure `GPA` is between 0.0 and 4.0.\n",
    "2. Define a `Classroom` class that contains a list of students. Add an indexer that allows access by student ID (string). Also add a method to get the average GPA.\n",
    "3. Create a `Matrix` class that uses a 2D array internally and provides an indexer with two integers (row, column) to get and set values.\n",
    "4. Experiment with the `with` expression: create a record, modify a copy, and verify the original is unchanged.\n",
    "5. Write a program that demonstrates value equality with records vs. reference equality with classes by comparing two objects with identical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let\u2019s move on to Chapter 8, where we\u2019ll explore the fascinating world of constructors and object initialization!"
