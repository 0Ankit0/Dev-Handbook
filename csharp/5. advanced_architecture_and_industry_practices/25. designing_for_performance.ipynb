    "# Chapter 25: Designing for Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance is a feature. Users expect applications to be responsive, fast, and resource\u2011efficient. In C#, writing high\u2011performance code often means understanding how memory is managed, minimizing allocations, and using modern language features that give you fine\u2011grained control. This chapter focuses on techniques and tools to design and measure performance in your C# applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The role of **`Span<T>`** and **`Memory<T>`** for working with contiguous memory without allocations.\n",
    "- **`ref struct`** and **`ref returns`** \u2013 how to safely return references and avoid copies.\n",
    "- Why **`StringBuilder`** is essential for string concatenation in loops.\n",
    "- **Benchmarking** with **BenchmarkDotNet** to measure performance accurately.\n",
    "- **Profiling** \u2013 identifying bottlenecks in your application.\n",
    "- Other performance tips: object pooling, avoiding LINQ overhead in hot paths, and using `ArrayPool`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a toolkit for writing high\u2011performance C# code and the ability to measure and validate your improvements.\n",

    "## 25.1 Understanding Performance in .NET\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance in .NET involves several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CPU time** \u2013 how much work the processor does.\n",
    "- **Memory allocations** \u2013 creating objects on the heap, which triggers garbage collection.\n",
    "- **Latency** \u2013 time waiting for I/O or other operations.\n",
    "- **Throughput** \u2013 number of operations per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "The garbage collector (GC) is a major consideration. Frequent allocations lead to more GC collections, which can pause your application. Writing high\u2011performance code often means **reducing allocations** and **reusing objects** where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 25.2 `Span<T>` and `Memory<T>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Span<T>`** and **`Memory<T>`** are revolutionary types introduced to enable high\u2011performance memory manipulation without allocations. They provide a type\u2011safe view over contiguous memory, which can be an array, a slice of an array, or even unmanaged memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Span<T>`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Span<T>` is a **ref struct** \u2013 it can only live on the stack, not on the heap. This makes it incredibly lightweight. You can use it to work with slices of arrays, strings, or native buffers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };\n",
    "Span<int> span = numbers.AsSpan();\n",
    "Span<int> slice = span.Slice(2, 3); // { 3, 4, 5 }\n",
    "slice[0] = 30; // modifies the original array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a `Span` from unmanaged memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Span<byte> buffer = stackalloc byte[256]; // stack allocation \u2013 fast!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Span<T>` is perfect for performance\u2011critical paths because it avoids copying and heap allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Memory<T>`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Memory<T>` is similar to `Span<T>`, but it can live on the heap. It's useful for asynchronous methods because it doesn't have the stack\u2011only restriction. You can think of it as a holder for a span that can be stored in a field or used with `async` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Memory<int> memory = numbers.AsMemory();\n",
    "// later, you can get a span from it in a synchronous context:\n",
    "Span<int> span = memory.Span;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `Span<T>` for synchronous, performance\u2011sensitive operations that work with contiguous memory.\n",
    "- Use `Memory<T>` when you need to store the reference or use it across `await` boundaries.\n",
    "- Both are allocation\u2011free when slicing.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 25.3 `ref struct` and `ref Returns`\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ref struct`\n",
    "\n",
    "A `ref struct` is a structure that is guaranteed to be allocated only on the stack. This is enforced by the compiler, preventing boxing and heap allocations. `Span<T>` itself is a `ref struct`. You can define your own:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public ref struct MyRefStruct\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public int Value;\n",
    "    // No heap allocations allowed inside\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful for lightweight wrappers that should never escape the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ref Returns`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can return a reference to a variable from a method, allowing the caller to modify the original variable directly. This can avoid copying large structs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public ref int FindMax(int[] numbers)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int maxIndex = 0;\n",
    "    for (int i = 1; i < numbers.Length; i++)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if (numbers[i] > numbers[maxIndex])\n",
    "            maxIndex = i;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return ref numbers[maxIndex]; // return reference to the element\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "int[] arr = { 1, 5, 3, 9, 2 };\n",
    "ref int max = ref FindMax(arr);\n",
    "max = 100; // modifies the array element\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(arr[3]); // 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`ref returns` are useful in high\u2011performance scenarios where you want to avoid copying and directly manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 25.4 `StringBuilder` \u2013 Efficient String Concatenation\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are immutable in C#. When you concatenate strings with `+`, a new string is allocated each time. In a loop, this can create enormous GC pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string result = \"\";\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)\n",

    "    sb.Append(i);\n",
    "}\n",
    "string result = sb.ToString();\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 25.5 Benchmarking with BenchmarkDotNet\n",
    "\n",
    "To know whether a performance optimization actually helps, you need to **measure**. Guessing leads to wasted effort. **BenchmarkDotNet** is the industry\u2011standard library for benchmarking .NET code. It runs your code multiple times, warms up, performs statistical analysis, and outputs clear results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up BenchmarkDotNet\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the NuGet package to a project (usually a separate console app):\n",

    "## 25.7 Additional Performance Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating and destroying many objects (e.g., buffers, connections) can be expensive. An object pool reuses instances. .NET provides `ArrayPool<T>` for arrays and `ObjectPool<T>` in Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "byte[] buffer = ArrayPool<byte>.Shared.Rent(1024);\n",
    "try\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // use buffer\n",
    "}\n",
    "finally\n",
    "{\n",
    "    ArrayPool<byte>.Shared.Return(buffer);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoiding LINQ Overhead in Hot Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "LINQ is expressive but can allocate enumerators and lambdas. In performance\u2011critical loops, prefer `for` or `foreach` with direct access.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// LINQ version (allocates)\n",
    "var sum = data.Where(x => x > 0).Sum();\n",
    "\n",
    "// Manual loop (no allocation)\n",
    "int sum = 0;\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < data.Length; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    if (data[i] > 0) sum += data[i];\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structs vs. Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Structs are value types allocated on the stack (or inline in arrays). They can reduce GC pressure but copying large structs is expensive. Use structs for small, immutable data (e.g., `Point`, `Color`). Measure to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `unsafe` Code and Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "For extreme performance, C# allows `unsafe` code with pointers. This bypasses type safety and bounds checks. Use only when absolutely necessary and after proving the benefit with benchmarks.\n",

    "## 25.8 Putting It All Together: Optimizing a String Processing Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a method that extracts numbers from a string and see how we can optimize it step by step.\n",

    "public List<int> ExtractNumbers(string input)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    var result = new List<int>();\n",
    "    foreach (char c in input)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if (char.IsDigit(c))\n",

    "    }\n",
    "    return result;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems:\n",
    "- `c.ToString()` allocates a new string each time.\n",
    "- `int.Parse` on a single char is overkill.\n",
    "- Returning a `List<T>` allocates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimized version using `Span<T>` and avoiding allocations:\n",

    "public int[] ExtractNumbersFast(string input)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Count digits first to allocate exact array\n",
    "    Span<char> digits = stackalloc char[input.Length];\n",
    "    int count = 0;\n",

    "    }\n",
    "    return result;\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This version:\n",
    "- Uses a stack\u2011allocated buffer for digits (no heap allocation if input length not huge).\n",
    "- Uses character arithmetic instead of parsing.\n",
    "- Returns an array (could also return `Span<int>` if the caller is synchronous).\n",

    "1. **Measure Before Optimizing** \u2013 use BenchmarkDotNet and profilers to find real bottlenecks.\n",
    "2. **Minimize Allocations** \u2013 allocations lead to GC pressure. Reuse buffers, use `Span<T>`, and prefer structs for small data.\n",
    "3. **Use `StringBuilder` for Dynamic Concatenation** \u2013 never use `+` in a loop.\n",
    "4. **Prefer `for` over LINQ in Hot Paths** \u2013 LINQ adds overhead.\n",
    "5. **Use `ArrayPool` for Temporary Buffers** \u2013 avoid repeated allocations.\n",
    "6. **Consider Using `Span<T>` and `Memory<T>`** for modern, allocation\u2011free memory manipulation.\n",
    "7. **Avoid Locking in Hot Paths** \u2013 use concurrent collections or lock\u2011free techniques.\n",
    "8. **Make Decisions Based on Data** \u2013 don't guess; benchmark.\n",
    "9. **Write Clear Code First, Then Optimize** \u2013 readability matters. Only optimize where necessary.\n",
    "10. **Stay Updated** \u2013 each .NET version brings performance improvements.\n",

    "In the next chapter, **Key Design Patterns in C#**, we'll explore common design patterns that solve recurring problems in software architecture. You'll learn how to implement patterns like Singleton, Factory, Strategy, and Observer in C#, and understand when to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a method that reverses a string without allocating any new string (use `Span<char>` and stack allocation). Benchmark it against the naive approach using `new string`.\n",
    "2. Use BenchmarkDotNet to compare `StringBuilder` with regular concatenation for building a string of 10,000 numbers. Observe the allocation differences.\n",
    "3. Profile a simple application that reads a large file and processes its lines. Identify the hottest method and try to optimize it.\n",
    "4. Implement a simple object pool for `byte[]` buffers using `ConcurrentBag`. Measure the performance improvement over allocating new arrays each time.\n",
    "5. Experiment with `ref returns`: create a method that returns a reference to the largest element in an array, and modify it through the reference.\n",
