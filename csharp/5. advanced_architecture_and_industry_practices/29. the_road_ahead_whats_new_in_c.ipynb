    "# Chapter 29: The Road Ahead \u2013 What's New in C#\n",
    "\n",
    "C# is a language that continues to evolve. With each new version, Microsoft introduces features that make the language more expressive, safer, and more performant. Staying up\u2011to\u2011date with these changes helps you write cleaner code, avoid common pitfalls, and leverage the full power of the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll explore the most significant additions to C# from recent versions (C# 9 through C# 12 and beyond). You'll learn about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Records** and **init\u2011only properties** \u2013 immutability made easy.\n",
    "- **Top\u2011level statements** \u2013 reducing ceremony for simple programs.\n",
    "- **Pattern matching enhancements** \u2013 more powerful `switch` expressions, property patterns, list patterns.\n",
    "- **Nullable reference types** \u2013 fighting the billion\u2011dollar mistake.\n",
    "- **Global using directives** and **file\u2011scoped namespaces** \u2013 cleaning up your code files.\n",
    "- **Required members** \u2013 enforcing initialization.\n",
    "- **Primary constructors** \u2013 concise class definitions.\n",
    "- **Interceptors** (preview) and other experimental features.\n",
    "- How to keep up with the ecosystem and experiment with preview features.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a roadmap of the language's evolution and be ready to adopt new idioms in your projects.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 29.1 The Evolution of C#\n",
    "\n",
    "C# has come a long way since its 1.0 release in 2002. The language has embraced functional programming concepts, added pattern matching, improved performance with `ref` structs and `Span<T>`, and made code more concise with records and top\u2011level statements. The release cadence is now regular, with new versions arriving yearly alongside .NET updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the key features introduced in recent versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 29.2 C# 9 \u2013 Records, Init\u2011Only, and Top\u2011Level Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "C# 9 was a landmark release, introducing features that fundamentally changed how we model data and write entry\u2011point code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Records\n",
    "\n",
    "Records are reference types with built\u2011in value semantics. They are perfect for immutable data objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This single line creates a record with:\n",
    "- Init\u2011only properties `FirstName` and `LastName`.\n",
    "- A primary constructor.\n",
    "- Value\u2011based equality (`Equals`, `GetHashCode`, `==`/`!=`).\n",
    "- A `ToString` that displays the property names and values.\n",
    "- A non\u2011destructive mutation method `with`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var person1 = new Person(\"Alice\", \"Smith\");\n",
    "var person2 = person1 with { LastName = \"Jones\" };\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(person1 == person2); // False (different data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Records can also have methods and other members. They are ideal for DTOs, domain value objects, and immutable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Init\u2011Only Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Init\u2011only properties (`init` accessor) allow properties to be set only during object initialization, after which they become read\u2011only.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string FirstName { get; init; }\n",
    "    public string LastName { get; init; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This combines the flexibility of object initializers with immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top\u2011Level Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Top\u2011level statements eliminate the boilerplate of a `Main` method and class for simple programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System;\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler generates the necessary `Main` method and class. You can still access command\u2011line arguments via `args` and return an exit code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Matching Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "C# 9 introduced **relational patterns** (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), **logical patterns** (`and`, `or`, `not`), and **parenthesized patterns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int number = 42;\n",
    "string description = number switch\n",
    "{\n",
    "    < 0 => \"Negative\",\n",
    "    >= 0 and <= 10 => \"Small\",\n",
    "    > 10 and < 100 => \"Medium\",\n",
    "    >= 100 => \"Large\"\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other C# 9 Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target\u2011typed `new`** \u2013 `Person p = new();` when the type is obvious.\n",
    "- **`static` anonymous functions** \u2013 prevents capturing `this` unintentionally.\n",
    "- **Module initializers** \u2013 code that runs once per assembly.\n",
    "- **Covariant returns** \u2013 overrides can return a more derived type.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 29.3 C# 10 \u2013 Global Usings, File\u2011Scoped Namespaces, and More\n",
    "\n",
    "C# 10 built on C# 9, adding quality\u2011of\u2011life improvements and filling gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global Using Directives\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now declare a `global using` directive that applies to the entire project.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "global using System;\n",
    "global using System.Collections.Generic;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Place these in a single file (e.g., `GlobalUsings.cs`), and all other files in the project automatically have those namespaces imported. This reduces clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File\u2011Scoped Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Namespace declarations can now omit the braces, indenting the entire file one level less.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "namespace MyApp.Data;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Repository { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All declarations after the namespace line are within that namespace until the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Record Structs\n",
    "\n",
    "C# 10 introduced record structs \u2013 value types with record semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public record struct Point(int X, int Y);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Record structs have value semantics but avoid heap allocations. They are useful for small, immutable data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improved Lambda Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural types** for lambdas \u2013 the compiler can infer a delegate type if it's unambiguous.\n",
    "- **Attributes on lambdas** \u2013 you can now apply attributes to lambda expressions.\n",
    "- **Return type inference** \u2013 you can specify the return type explicitly: `var add = int (int a, int b) => a + b;`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constant Interpolated Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now create constant strings using interpolation, as long as all placeholders are constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "const string Greeting = \"Hello\";\n",
    "const string Message = $\"{Greeting}, World!\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other C# 10 Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mix declarations and expressions in deconstruction** \u2013 `var (x, y) = point;` already worked; now you can mix `var` with existing variables.\n",
    "- **Assignment and declaration in the same deconstruction** \u2013 not directly, but enhancements to deconstruction.\n",
    "- **`CallerArgumentExpression`** attribute \u2013 captures the expression passed to a parameter for better error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 29.4 C# 11 \u2013 Required Members, Raw String Literals, and List Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "C# 11 continued the trend of making code safer and more expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Members\n",
    "\n",
    "The `required` modifier ensures that a property or field is initialized during object construction. This is enforced by the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public required string FirstName { get; init; }\n",
    "    public required string LastName { get; init; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "var p = new Person { FirstName = \"Alice\", LastName = \"Smith\" }; // OK\n",
    "var p2 = new Person { FirstName = \"Bob\" }; // Compiler error: LastName required\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially useful for DTOs and domain objects where certain properties must always be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw String Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw string literals allow you to embed arbitrary text without escaping. They start and end with three double\u2011quote characters (`\"\"\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string json = \"\"\"\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "        \"age\": 30\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \"\"\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation is stripped relative to the closing quotes, making it easy to embed JSON, XML, SQL, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "List patterns (introduced in C# 11) let you match arrays and lists against patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\n",
    "string result = numbers switch\n",
    "{\n",
    "    [1, 2, .., 5] => \"Starts with 1,2 and ends with 5\",\n",
    "    [1, ..] => \"Starts with 1\",\n",
    "    [.., 5] => \"Ends with 5\",\n",
    "    [_, _, _] => \"Exactly three elements\",\n",
    "    [] => \"Empty\",\n",
    "    _ => \"Something else\"\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The slice pattern `..` matches zero or more elements and can optionally capture a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other C# 11 Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ref` fields in `ref struct`** \u2013 allows `ref struct` types to contain `ref` fields, enabling more efficient span\u2011like types.\n",
    "- **File\u2011local types** \u2013 the `file` access modifier restricts a type's visibility to the source file it's declared in.\n",
    "- **Generic attributes** \u2013 you can now define generic attribute classes.\n",
    "- **`nameof` in attribute constructors** \u2013 works on type parameters.\n",
    "- **`Utf8String` literals** \u2013 but later refined; still experimental.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 29.5 C# 12 \u2013 Primary Constructors, Collection Expressions, and More\n",
    "\n",
    "C# 12, released with .NET 8, brought further refinements and new syntactic sugar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary constructors are now available for all classes and structs (not just records). Parameters become available throughout the class body.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person(string firstName, string lastName)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string FullName => $\"{firstName} {lastName}\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces boilerplate for simple classes and makes dependencies explicit. Primary constructor parameters can be captured and used anywhere, but they are not automatically exposed as properties \u2013 you must define them manually if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collection Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Collection expressions provide a concise syntax for creating common collection types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// Arrays\n",
    "int[] a = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n",
    "\n",
    "// Lists (requires `using System.Collections.Generic;`)\n",
    "List<int> b = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n",
    "\n",
    "// Spreading\n",
    "int[] c = [.. a, 5, 6];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The spread operator `..` expands an existing collection into a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `params` Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "The `params` keyword can now be used with any collection type, not just arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public void WriteNumbers(params List<int> numbers) { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows callers to pass a list of numbers without creating an explicit array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `nameof` with Unbound Generic Types\n",
    "\n",
    "`nameof` can now be used with unbound generic types, like `nameof(List<>)` which returns `\"List\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other C# 12 Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inline arrays** \u2013 a low\u2011level feature for fixed\u2011size buffers, mainly for interop.\n",
    "- **`DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler`** improvements for custom interpolation.\n",
    "- **`Experimental` attribute** \u2013 to mark APIs as experimental.\n",
    "- **`Ref readonly` parameters** \u2013 but more of a refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 29.6 Preview Features: What's Coming Next\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft often previews features in minor updates. Some features that might appear in future versions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interceptors** \u2013 allow methods to be replaced at compile time, enabling source\u2011generator\u2011based AOP.\n",
    "- **Discriminated unions** \u2013 (often discussed) would allow types that can be one of several cases.\n",
    "- **Extension members** \u2013 a more comprehensive extension mechanism.\n",
    "- **First\u2011class support for `required` in records** \u2013 already there, but enhancements.\n",
    "- **Collection literals** \u2013 even more seamless syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "To experiment with preview features, you need to set `<LangVersion>preview</LangVersion>` in your project file and use the latest .NET SDK preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 29.7 Putting It All Together: A Modern C# Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a small program that uses several of these new features: records, primary constructors, collection expressions, and pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
