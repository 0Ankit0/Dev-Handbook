    "\n",
    "This chapter adds **true realtime** to your Django project using **Django Channels**\n",
    "(WebSockets). We’ll build an **organization-scoped notifications stream** so that\n",
    "when something happens (e.g., a task status changes), connected browsers receive a\n",
    "message instantly—no refresh needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on current upstream releases:\n",
    "- `channels` latest stable is **4.3.2** (released Nov 20, 2025) and it lists\n",
    "  compatibility up through Django **6.0** on PyPI.\n",
    "- `channels_redis` is the official Redis-backed channel layer package.\n",

    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain Channels architecture: **ASGI**, **Consumers**, **Routing**, **Channel\n",
    "   Layer**, **Groups**.\n",
    "2. Configure Django + Channels to serve:\n",
    "   - HTTP as normal\n",
    "   - WebSocket connections under `/ws/...`\n",
    "3. Authenticate WebSockets using Django sessions (cookie-based auth).\n",
    "4. Prevent cross-site WebSocket abuse using **Origin validators** (Channels security).\n",
    "5. Build an **OrgNotificationsConsumer** that:\n",
    "   - requires login\n",
    "   - requires org membership\n",
    "   - joins an org “group”\n",
    "   - sends JSON events to clients\n",
    "6. Broadcast events from normal Django code (services) into the channel layer.\n",
    "7. Run everything under an ASGI server (Uvicorn) locally.\n",
    "8. Write automated tests for WebSockets using `WebsocketCommunicator`.\n",

    "## 28.1 Why WebSockets (and when you should NOT use them)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 28.1.1 What WebSockets give you\n",
    "WebSockets create a long-lived connection:\n",
    "- browser opens one connection\n",
    "- server can push messages any time\n",
    "- client can send messages without new HTTP requests\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables:\n",
    "- live notifications\n",
    "- chat\n",
    "- presence/typing indicators\n",
    "- realtime dashboards\n",
    "- collaborative editing (harder)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 28.1.2 Alternatives and tradeoffs\n",
    "**Polling** (HTTP GET every N seconds)\n",
    "- simple\n",
    "- wastes requests when nothing changes\n",
    "- latency depends on interval\n",
    "\n",
    "**SSE** (Server-Sent Events)\n",
    "- server → client only (no client push)\n",
    "- simpler than WebSockets for “stream updates”\n",
    "- not as universal as HTTP, but good for many realtime feeds\n",
    "\n",
    "**WebSockets**\n",
    "- full duplex\n",
    "- more moving parts (ASGI server, channel layer, scaling)\n",
    "- requires careful security (Origin restrictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb:**\n",
    "- Use WebSockets when you need frequent near-instant updates or bidirectional comms.\n",
    "- Don’t add WebSockets “because realtime is cool” if polling is enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 28.2 Channels Architecture (The Real Mental Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "Channels adds a new layer to Django:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 28.2.1 Consumers\n",
    "A **Consumer** is like a view, but for event-based protocols (WebSockets).\n",
    "It handles events like:\n",
    "- connect\n",
    "- receive message\n",
    "- disconnect\n",
    "- messages sent via the channel layer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 28.2.2 Routing\n",
    "Separate from `urls.py`. WebSockets use **ASGI routing**, typically matching paths\n",
    "like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `/ws/orgs/acme/notifications/`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 28.2.3 Channel Layer\n",
    "A channel layer is a message bus between:\n",
    "- different consumer instances\n",
    "- different server processes\n",
    "- different machines\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, it’s usually **Redis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 28.2.4 Groups\n",
    "A **group** is a broadcast target.\n",
    "You add each connected socket to a group:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `org-<org_id>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can broadcast:\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Task status changed” → everyone connected to that org group receives it.\n",

    "## 28.3 Install Channels + Redis Layer\n",

    "    ),\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- We use `re_path` because WebSocket routing commonly uses regex patterns.\n",
    "- `org_slug` is captured from the URL and passed in `scope[\"url_route\"][\"kwargs\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 28.6.3 Create `config/routing.py`\n",

    "Replace your ASGI file with this pattern:\n",

    "#### Why these wrappers matter (security + auth)\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Routing mismatch (URL pattern doesn’t match)\n",
    "4. Consumer not called with `.as_asgi()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Checklist:\n",
    "- Confirm your websocket URL matches routing regex exactly.\n",
    "- Confirm `AllowedHostsOriginValidator` is present and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` includes:\n",
    "  - `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and your domain(s)\n",
    "- Confirm your consumer uses `.as_asgi()` in routing.\n",
    "- Run under an ASGI server (Uvicorn), not the default Django dev server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem B: Events are not delivered across tabs/processes\n",
    "Cause:\n",
    "- using InMemoryChannelLayer and multiple processes\n",
    "Fix:\n",
    "- use Redis channel layer (`channels_redis`)\n",
    "- ensure all server instances share the same Redis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem C: “RuntimeError: You cannot use the database_sync_to_async wrapper in the same thread”\n",
    "Cause:\n",
    "- incorrect mixing of event loops/threads (rare but happens)\n",
    "Fix:\n",
    "- ensure you’re using async consumer properly\n",
    "- keep ORM calls inside `database_sync_to_async` wrappers\n",
