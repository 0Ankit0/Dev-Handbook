    "\n",
    "Django supports **asynchronous (\u201casync\u201d) views** and can run an **async-enabled\n",
    "request stack** when deployed under **ASGI**. Async views also run under **WSGI**,\n",
    "but with important limitations and overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter teaches you the practical, industry-grade truth:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Async is not \u201cmake everything faster.\u201d\n",
    "- Async helps primarily with **I/O-bound concurrency** (calling other services,\n",
    "  long-polling, slow streaming), not CPU-heavy work.\n",
    "- You only get the full benefit of an async stack if your middleware stack is\n",
    "  compatible (no sync middleware forcing thread-per-request emulation).\n",
    "- Django\u2019s ORM has **async variants** for query-evaluating operations; however,\n",
    "  **transactions still don\u2019t work in async mode** (per Django async docs), so you\n",
    "  need patterns for \u201ctransactional sync islands.\u201d\n",

    "1. Explain WSGI vs ASGI with a correct mental model and deployment implications.\n",
    "2. Write async FBVs and async CBVs correctly (and know what you must not mix).\n",
    "3. Use async to run concurrent I/O (e.g., multiple external HTTP calls).\n",
    "4. Use Django\u2019s async ORM interfaces (`a...` methods, `async for`) safely.\n",
    "5. Understand and fix `SynchronousOnlyOperation` (async safety protection).\n",
    "6. Understand why **transactions don\u2019t work in async mode** and how to handle it\n",
    "   with a \u201csync island\u201d wrapped by `sync_to_async`.\n",
    "7. Understand middleware compatibility and why sync middleware can negate async benefits.\n",
    "8. Run your Django app under an ASGI server (Uvicorn) locally to validate behavior.\n",
    "9. Write at least one async test using Django\u2019s async test client.\n",
