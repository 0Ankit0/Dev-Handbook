    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Authentication and authorization (non-negotiable)\n",
    "1. As an anonymous user, I cannot connect to realtime endpoints.\n",
    "2. As a logged-in user, I can connect only to orgs I belong to.\n",
    "3. As a user in org A, I can never receive messages for org B.\n",

    "## 3.2 Notifications stream (Track A baseline)\n",
    "4. As an org member, I can open a page and see live notifications without refreshing.\n",
    "5. When a task status changes, I receive a realtime event with:\n",
    "   - task_id\n",
    "   - action type (status_changed)\n",
    "   - minimal details (from/to)\n",
    "   - timestamp\n",
    "6. When an export job finishes, I receive:\n",
    "   - job_id\n",
    "   - status (done/failed)\n",
    "   - download link (if done and user authorized)\n",
    "\n",

    "- events are correctly scoped to org\n",
    "- payloads contain only needed fields (no sensitive data)\n",

    "## 3.3 Persistence + catch-up (reliability baseline)\n",
    "7. If I disconnect and reconnect, I can fetch missed notifications from the DB.\n",

    "Acceptance criteria:\n",
    "- on connect, server sends “last N events” or client calls a “fetch missed” endpoint\n",
    "- events are not lost permanently due to temporary disconnects\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4 Chat (optional stretch)\n",
    "8. As an org member, I can join a room and send messages.\n",
    "9. Messages are saved to DB and appear in order.\n",
    "10. A user cannot send more than X messages per minute (abuse protection).\n",
    "\n",

    "- message appears for all connected users in room\n",
