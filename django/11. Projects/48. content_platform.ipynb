    "# 3) Requirements (User Stories + Acceptance Criteria)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Public user stories\n",
    "1. **Browse articles**\n",
    "   - Visitor can open `/articles/` and see **published** articles only.\n",
    "   - Articles are ordered newest-first (define what \u201cnewest\u201d means: published_at or created_at).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Search**\n",
    "   - Visitor can search with `?q=...`.\n",
    "   - Search does not crash on empty or long strings.\n",
    "   - Search results are paginated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filter by tag**\n",
    "   - Visitor can filter by tag via query (`?tag=django`) OR tag pages (`/tags/django/`) (choose one for baseline; tag pages are a stretch goal).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Open an article**\n",
    "   - `/articles/<slug>/` renders:\n",
    "     - title, author, published date\n",
    "     - cover image if present\n",
    "     - tags\n",
    "     - body\n",
    "   - Drafts are not visible publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Editorial workflow stories\n",
    "5. **Create article**\n",
    "   - Authenticated user can create an article.\n",
    "   - Author is set by the server (not user input).\n",
    "   - Default status is DRAFT (recommended baseline).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Edit article**\n",
    "   - Author can edit their own articles.\n",
    "   - Staff can edit any article.\n",
    "   - Non-author non-staff gets 403 or 404 (pick a policy and be consistent).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Publish rules**\n",
    "   - Define publish policy:\n",
    "     - Option A (simpler): author can publish own article\n",
    "     - Option B (more editorial): only staff can publish\n",
    "   - Enforce the same rule in HTML and API (if you built API).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Comments stories\n",
    "8. **Submit comment**\n",
    "   - Anyone can submit a comment on a published article.\n",
    "   - Comment requires name + body (min length).\n",
    "   - On success: PRG redirect and \u201csubmitted for review\u201d message.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Moderate comments**\n",
    "   - Comments are not visible until approved.\n",
    "   - Staff can approve in Django admin (baseline).\n",
    "   - Approved comments appear on article detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4 SEO/ops baseline\n",
    "10. **Sitemap**\n",
    "   - `/sitemap.xml` exists and lists published article URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **robots.txt**\n",
    "   - `/robots.txt` exists and disallows `/admin/` and `/accounts/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Canonical URL**\n",
    "   - Article detail includes canonical link tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.5 Quality baseline\n",
    "13. **Tests exist**\n",
    "   - At minimum: visibility rules (draft vs published), list pagination, comment submission, permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Performance hygiene**\n",
    "   - Article list is paginated.\n",
    "   - No obvious N+1 when rendering tags/author.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Security hygiene**\n",
    "   - All POST forms include CSRF token.\n",
