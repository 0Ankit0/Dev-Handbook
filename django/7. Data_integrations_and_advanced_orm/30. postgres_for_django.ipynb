    "\n",
    "### 30.6.1 Concurrency and locking behavior\n",
    "- SQLite locks the entire database file for writes.\n",
    "- PostgreSQL locks rows/pages and supports much higher write concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical consequence:\n",
    "- SQLite can hide locking bugs because it serializes writes aggressively.\n",
    "- Postgres will expose real concurrency patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30.6.2 Transaction isolation differences\n",
    "Postgres default isolation is **READ COMMITTED**:\n",
    "- each statement sees a snapshot committed before the statement starts\n",
    "- non-repeatable reads are possible across statements in same transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite behaves differently in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must design:\n",
    "- idempotency in background tasks\n",
    "- correct locking for counters and \u201cassign next number\u201d workflows\n",
    "- safe migrations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30.6.3 Text comparisons and case sensitivity\n",
    "Postgres:\n",
    "- `LIKE` is case-sensitive\n",
    "- `ILIKE` is case-insensitive\n",
    "\n",
    "Django\u2019s `icontains` uses `ILIKE` on Postgres.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite case sensitivity rules differ and can vary by collation.\n",

    "Ordering with NULLs can differ by DB; always test the ordering you rely on.\n",

    "## 30.7 Inspect SQL and Query Plans (EXPLAIN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Postgres performance work is mostly about:\n",
    "- writing a query the planner can execute efficiently\n",
    "- adding indexes that match your filter/order patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30.7.1 Print query SQL from Django\n",
    "In shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from articles.models import Article\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "print(qs.explain())\n",

    "Your public list orders by published_at/created_at and only includes published.\n",
