    "1. Explain what makes migrations risky in production (locks, backfills, long DDL).\n",
    "2. Use the **expand/contract** pattern for safe changes across deployments.\n",
    "3. Add fields safely to large tables:\n",
    "   - nullable first\n",

    "6. Use `RunSQL` safely and understand when you must (indexes concurrently, extensions).\n",
    "7. Detect and mitigate locking issues (especially in PostgreSQL).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 31.1.1 Long-running DDL locks\n",
    "In PostgreSQL, certain schema changes require locks, potentially blocking writes or even reads:\n",
    "- altering column types\n",
    "- adding constraints in certain ways\n",
    "- creating indexes without CONCURRENTLY\n",
    "- dropping columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "- requests hang or time out\n",
    "- background workers pile up\n",
    "- incidents happen\n",

    "### 31.1.2 Backfills that scan huge tables\n",
    "A “simple” `UPDATE table SET new_col = ...` on 50 million rows can take:\n",
    "- minutes or hours\n",
    "- heavy I/O and CPU\n",
    "- lock contention\n",
    "\n",
    "### 31.1.3 Code and schema mismatch during deploy\n",
    "If you deploy new code that expects a new column **before** it exists, you get runtime errors.\n",
    "If you deploy migrations that remove a column before code stops using it, you get runtime errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why professional teams coordinate:\n",
    "- code deploy steps\n",
    "- migration steps\n",
    "- rollbacks\n",

    "## 31.2 The Industry Standard Pattern: Expand / Contract\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the single most important migration strategy for zero/low downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expand phase (backward compatible)\n",
    "- Add new column nullable\n",
    "- Add new table\n",
    "- Add new indexes\n",
    "- Add new code that can work with old + new schema\n",
    "\n",
    "### Migrate data\n",
    "- backfill new column gradually\n",
    "- keep app running\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contract phase (remove old)\n",
    "- make new column non-null\n",
    "- remove old columns / old code paths\n",
    "- clean up\n",
    "\n",
    "This supports “deploy code first, migrate later” or “migrate first, deploy later”\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose you want:\n",
    "- `Article.summary` required (non-null), max 300 chars\n",
    "- used in list pages and meta descriptions\n",
    "- must be backfilled from existing `body` for existing rows\n",

    "If you do it naïvely:\n",

    "python manage.py migrate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why `null=True` first\n",
    "Because your DB already has rows. If you add a non-null field, the DB needs a value\n",

    "- lock the table\n",
    "- set a default (which can rewrite entire table)\n",

    "Migrations must not import your current models directly because:\n",
    "- your code changes over time\n",
    "- migrations must run against historical states\n",
    "`apps.get_model` gives you the model state at migration time.\n",

    "Row-by-row updates are simple but slower. For truly large tables, you often:\n",
    "- do backfills in a management command\n",
    "- or use SQL `UPDATE ... SET summary = substring(body,1,300) WHERE summary IS NULL`\n",
    "  with careful chunking or `id` ranges\n",
    "- or use a job queue to backfill gradually\n",

    "## 31.7 Coordinating Code + Schema Changes (Deployment Strategy)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you deploy code and migrations separately (common in CI/CD pipelines), use this flow:\n",

    "### Explanation: why `atomic = False`\n",
    "PostgreSQL does not allow `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` inside a transaction.\n",
    "Django wraps migrations in transactions by default. Setting `atomic=False` allows\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need Django’s model state to change differently than the DB operation.\n",

    "Common use cases:\n",
    "- rename a column in DB without breaking old code\n",
    "- complex refactors where you keep old column temporarily but want new field name in Django\n",
    "- using DB views or computed columns\n",

    "Example conceptual pattern:\n",
    "- add a new column\n",
    "- keep old column\n",
    "- write to both\n",

    "\n",
    "For large tables, the best practice is often:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Schema migration** adds nullable column\n",
    "- **Code deploy** writes the new field for new writes\n",
    "- **Background backfill** (Celery job or management command) fills existing rows over hours/days\n",
    "- **Constraint migration** enforces NOT NULL later\n",

    "Professional pattern:\n",
    "1. Stop reading the column in code (deploy)\n",
