    "   - views are thin\n",
    "   - services encapsulate business rules\n",
    "   - Celery handles slow/fragile work\n",
    "3. Receive webhooks securely:\n",
    "   - CSRF exempt (correctly)\n",
    "   - signature verification (HMAC)\n",
    "   - timestamp + replay protection\n",
    "   - idempotency via unique event IDs\n",
    "   - fast 2xx response + async processing\n",
    "4. Store and serve files beyond local disk:\n",
    "   - correct Django settings (`MEDIA_ROOT`, `STORAGES`)\n",
    "   - object storage (S3-like) integration patterns\n",
    "   - private media strategies (authenticated access / signed URLs)\n",
    "5. Write tests for:\n",

    "\n",
    "- External APIs must be called with timeouts, safe retries, and clear error mapping.\n",
    "- Webhooks require signature verification + replay protection + idempotency + fast ACK.\n",
    "- Background tasks are the right place for slow and retryable processing.\n",
    "- File storage must be designed for persistence and privacy (public vs private media).\n",
    "- The clean architecture pattern is:\n",
    "  - views: thin\n",
    "  - integrations/services: business mapping\n",
    "  - tasks: retries + slow work\n",
    "  - DB constraints: idempotency\n",
