    "## 32. Advanced Model Patterns (Abstract Bases, Proxy Models, Generic Relations, Soft Deletes, Audit Logging)\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is about the model patterns that show up in **real** Django codebases\n",
    "once the app grows beyond simple CRUD:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \u201cWe need shared fields on many models\u201d \u2192 **abstract base models**\n",
    "- \u201cWe want a different behavior/view of the same table\u201d \u2192 **proxy models**\n",
    "- \u201cWe want to attach the same concept to multiple models\u201d \u2192 **generic relations**\n",
    "- \u201cWe can\u2019t hard-delete records\u201d \u2192 **soft deletes**\n",
    "- \u201cWe need an audit trail: who changed what\u201d \u2192 **audit logging**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn:\n",
    "- what each pattern is\n",
    "- when to use it (and when *not* to)\n",
    "- how it affects the DB schema and performance\n",

    "By the end you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose correctly between:\n",
    "   - abstract base model\n",
    "   - proxy model\n",
    "   - multi-table inheritance\n",
    "2. Build reusable \u201cmixins\u201d for common fields (timestamps, user tracking).\n",
    "3. Implement a proxy model to create a specialized admin and queryset for a subset\n",
    "   of rows without creating a new table.\n",
    "4. Use ContentTypes / GenericForeignKey to attach a model (e.g., AuditLog or\n",
    "   Reaction) to multiple target models.\n",
    "5. Implement soft delete safely (managers, querysets, admin integration).\n",
    "6. Understand the pitfalls:\n",
    "   - referential integrity limitations of GenericFK\n",
    "   - uniqueness constraints with soft deletes\n",
    "   - bulk operations bypassing `save()`\n",
    "7. Implement a production-grade audit log pattern and connect it to service-layer\n",

    "\n",
    "Django supports three main \u201cinheritance\u201d patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.1.1 Abstract base classes (most common, safest)\n",
    "- No separate DB table for the base class.\n",
    "- Fields are copied into each child table.\n",
    "- Great for shared fields and small shared methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use for:\n",
    "- `created_at` / `updated_at`\n",
    "- `created_by` / `updated_by`\n",
    "- `deleted_at`\n",
    "- \u201ctenant/org foreign key\u201d patterns (sometimes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.1.2 Proxy models (same DB table, different Python behavior)\n",
    "- No new table.\n",
    "- Used to change:\n",
    "  - default ordering\n",
    "  - default manager/queryset\n",
    "  - admin presentation\n",
    "  - methods\n",
    "- Great for \u201cPublishedArticle\u201d vs \u201cDraftArticle\u201d views of the same `Article` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.1.3 Multi-table inheritance (creates a new table per subclass)\n",
    "- Base model has its own table.\n",
    "- Each subclass has its own table with a OneToOne link to base table.\n",
    "- Queries often require joins.\n",
    "- Harder to evolve, can surprise you in performance and migration complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use only when:\n",
    "- you truly need \u201cis-a\u201d relationships with different schemas\n",
    "- and you\u2019re okay with join overhead and complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry guidance:**  \n",
    "Use abstract bases and proxies frequently. Use multi-table inheritance rarely.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 32.2 Abstract Base Models (Reusable Fields Without Extra Tables)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.2.1 The classic example: timestamps\n",
    "You already use timestamps in multiple models (`Article`, `Task`, `Comment`,\n",
    "`TaskEvent`, `TaskExportJob`, etc.). Centralizing them prevents drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create `core/models.py` (create a `core` app if you don\u2019t have one; recommended for\n",
    "shared base classes):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py startapp core\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "INSTALLED_APPS += [\"core\"]\n",

    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        abstract = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why `abstract = True` matters\n",
    "It tells Django:\n",
    "- do not create a table for `TimeStampedModel`\n",
    "- just copy its fields into subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.2.2 Apply it to a model (example: Tag)\n",
    "Update `articles/models.py`:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "from core.models import TimeStampedModel\n",

    "Avoid abstract bases when:\n",

    "        return Article.objects.published()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This defines a proxy but doesn\u2019t yet change query behavior. The better approach is\n",
    "a custom manager on the proxy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class PublishedArticleManager(models.Manager):\n",
    "    def get_queryset(self):\n",

    "        ordering = [\"-published_at\", \"-created_at\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What you get\n",
    "- `PublishedArticle.objects.all()` returns only published rows.\n",
    "- It still uses the same DB table as `Article`.\n",
    "- No migrations are created (no schema change).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.3.2 Proxy models in admin (very common)\n",
    "Register a separate admin for `PublishedArticle` to give editors a focused view:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "- \u201cPublished articles\u201d (filtered)  \n",
    "Both point to the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.3.3 When *not* to use proxy models\n",
    "Avoid proxies if:\n",
    "- you need a different schema/table (then it\u2019s not a proxy problem)\n",
    "- you can solve it with a normal queryset and don\u2019t need separate admin behavior\n",

    "\n",
    "Multi-table inheritance creates multiple tables and joins automatically.\n",

    "If you do not, you must accept \u201cunique forever\u201d semantics.\n",

    "Your service layer should handle audit logging explicitly. Don\u2019t assume `save()` is\n",
    "called in bulk operations (`queryset.update()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitfall D: Soft delete + cascades\n",
    "A DB-level `on_delete=CASCADE` does not \u201csoft cascade.\u201d\n",
    "If you soft delete a parent, children remain unless your code handles it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategy:\n",
