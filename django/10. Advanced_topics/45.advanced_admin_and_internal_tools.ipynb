    "- internal dashboards\n",
    "- operational tools (retries, reprocessing jobs)\n",
    "- content moderation consoles\n",
    "- reporting tools\n",
    "- support tools (impersonation carefully, user lookup)\n",
    "- data quality tools (integrity checks, cleanup)\n",

    "\n",
    "- custom admin pages and dashboards\n",
    "- admin performance optimization\n",
    "- safe internal actions and reprocessing\n",
    "- bulk operations with confirmation\n",
    "- admin-only reporting with CSV export\n",

    "\n",
    "By the end, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customize admin UI at a professional level:\n",
    "   - custom list displays, filters, querysets\n",
    "   - custom admin views (non-model pages)\n",
    "2. Build internal dashboards using admin templates.\n",
    "3. Add safe admin actions that:\n",
    "   - enforce permissions\n",
    "   - are idempotent\n",
    "   - log/audit the action\n",
    "4. Optimize admin performance (avoid N+1; annotate/prefetch; index awareness).\n",
    "5. Provide internal reporting/export tools safely.\n",
    "6. Write tests for critical admin custom actions and permissions (smoke tests).\n",
    "\n",

    "## 45.1 Admin as an Internal Product (Mindset)\n",
    "\n",
    "Treat admin tools like product features:\n",
    "- correctness matters\n",
    "- security matters\n",
    "- UX matters (staff efficiency)\n",
    "- performance matters at scale\n",
    "\n",
    "Admin tools often have higher \u201cblast radius\u201d than user-facing features because they\n",
    "can mass edit and reprocess events.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 45.2 Admin Performance Optimization (Repeatable Patterns)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 45.2.1 Never do per-row DB queries in list_display\n",
    "If list_display references related fields or computed values:\n",
    "- use `select_related` for FK/O2O\n",
    "- use `prefetch_related` for M2M\n",
    "- use annotation for counts\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned these earlier. In admin they are essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 45.2.2 Use `get_queryset` in ModelAdmin\n",
    "Example (export jobs list):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_queryset(self, request):\n",
    "    qs = super().get_queryset(request)\n",
    "    return qs.select_related(\"organization\", \"created_by\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 45.2.3 Use database indexes for filters/order\n",
    "If you filter by `status`, `created_at`, make sure you have indexes (you added some).\n",
    "Admin is essentially a reporting UI; indexes matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 45.3 Build a Real Ops Dashboard (Custom Admin View)\n",
    "\n",
    "We\u2019ll add a custom page accessible from admin:\n",
    "- `/admin/ops/` showing system operational info\n",
    "\n",
    "### 45.3.1 Create an admin \u201csite\u201d view (simple pattern)\n",
    "We can implement a custom admin view by adding a URL under admin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create `config/admin_ops.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from __future__ import annotations\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 45.3.2 Wire the URL into admin\n",
    "Edit `config/urls.py` and extend admin URLs by overriding `admin.site.get_urls` is\n",
    "the classic approach. But simplest is to add a path under admin via URLconf:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.contrib import admin\n",
    "from django.urls import path, include\n",
    "\n",
    "from config.admin_ops import ops_dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    path(\"admin/ops/\", ops_dashboard, name=\"ops_dashboard\"),\n",
    "    path(\"admin/\", admin.site.urls),\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why this works\n",
    "- `/admin/ops/` is protected by `staff_member_required`\n",
    "- It is still part of the same domain and admin context\n",
    "- You can link it from admin templates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 45.3.3 Create the admin dashboard template\n",
    "Create `templates/admin/ops_dashboard.html`:\n",
