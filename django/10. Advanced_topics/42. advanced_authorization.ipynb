    "1. Explain RBAC vs ABAC vs PBAC (and choose appropriately).\n",
    "2. Write a centralized policy layer that answers:\n",
    "   - “Can actor perform action X on resource Y in tenant Z?”\n",
    "3. Keep permissions consistent across:\n",
    "   - HTML views\n",
    "   - DRF endpoints\n",
    "   - admin actions\n",
    "   - background jobs\n",
    "4. Enforce object-level rules safely (not just model-level perms).\n",
    "5. Return correct HTTP responses (401/403/404 policy) and log/audit denials.\n",
    "6. Add custom permissions to models and groups cleanly.\n",

    "3. **Be consistent**: Same rule used in HTML view, API endpoint, admin action.\n",
