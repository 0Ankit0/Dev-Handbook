    "2. Organize code for scale:\n",

    "   - internal packages (core) vs domain apps\n",
    "3. Prevent dependency spaghetti:\n",
    "   - forbid cross-imports except through explicit APIs\n",
    "   - avoid circular dependencies\n",
    "4. Introduce feature flags safely (release without deploying risky behavior).\n",
    "5. Create architectural enforcement:\n",
    "   - static checks (import rules)\n",
    "   - tests that enforce boundaries\n",
    "6. Manage settings and environment configurations cleanly.\n",
    "7. Adopt conventions for migrations, tasks, and event/audit logging at scale.\n",
