    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use **property-based testing** to find edge cases automatically.\n",
    "2. Write **contract tests** for your API using OpenAPI (schema-driven tests).\n",
    "3. Add **load tests** (not unit tests) to verify performance and capacity.\n",
    "4. Define and enforce **quality gates**:\n",
    "   - coverage minimums\n",
    "   - query-count budgets\n",
    "   - performance budgets (p95 latency targets)\n",
    "   - “no missing migrations”\n",
    "   - dependency audit and basic security checks\n",
    "5. Reduce test flakiness by controlling time, randomness, concurrency, and external calls.\n",
    "6. Create a “quality plan” document that says what you test, how, and why.\n",
