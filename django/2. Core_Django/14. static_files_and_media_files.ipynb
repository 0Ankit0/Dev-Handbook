    "## 14. Static Files and Media Files (Correct Setup, Real Uploads, Dev vs Production)\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter formalizes two things that *every* real Django app must get right:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Static files**: assets shipped with your code (CSS/JS/images).\n",
    "2. **Media files**: user-uploaded files (avatars, documents, product photos).\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginners often mix these up. In production, treating them incorrectly leads to:\n",
    "- broken CSS/JS after deploy\n",
    "- missing user uploads\n",
    "- security vulnerabilities (serving private files publicly)\n",
    "- performance issues (Django serving files instead of a proper web server/CDN)\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll implement:\n",
    "- a clean static file structure\n",
    "- a real file upload stored on disk in dev\n",
    "- correct settings and URL wiring\n",
    "- security validation patterns for uploads\n",
    "- templates that display uploaded images/files\n",
    "- tests for upload behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.0 Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain static vs media with production implications.\n",
    "2. Configure:\n",
    "   - `STATIC_URL`, `STATICFILES_DIRS`, `STATIC_ROOT`\n",
    "   - `MEDIA_URL`, `MEDIA_ROOT`\n",
    "3. Serve media in development safely.\n",
    "4. Add a model with `ImageField`/`FileField` and upload via ModelForm.\n",
    "5. Validate uploaded files (size/type) and avoid common security mistakes.\n",
    "6. Understand `collectstatic` and why production serving is different.\n",
    "7. Write tests using Django’s test client to upload files.\n",

    "## 14.1 Static vs Media: Definitions You Must Never Forget\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static files (code-owned)\n",
    "- Created by developers\n",
    "- Versioned with git\n",
    "- Deployed with the application\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - `site.css`\n",
    "  - `app.js`\n",
    "  - logo images used by UI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Media files (user-owned)\n",
    "- Uploaded by users or generated dynamically\n",
    "- Not part of your code repo\n",
    "- Must persist across deploys\n",
    "- Requires backup and storage strategy\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - profile photo uploads\n",
    "  - article cover image uploads\n",
    "  - invoices PDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry reality**\n",
    "- Static is usually served via CDN or Nginx after being “collected.”\n",
    "- Media is stored on persistent storage (disk volume, S3, etc.) and served separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.2 Static Files Configuration (Correct, Professional Setup)\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `config/settings.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.2.1 Core static settings\n",
    "You typically have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "STATIC_URL = \"static/\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means: “static files are accessible under the URL prefix `/static/`.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.2.2 Where static files live during development: `STATICFILES_DIRS`\n",
    "You already created:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "static/css/site.css\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To tell Django to look in `BASE_DIR/static/`, set:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "STATICFILES_DIRS = [\n",
    "    BASE_DIR / \"static\",\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- This is a list of directories where you keep static assets during development.\n",
    "- Django will search these directories to serve static assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.2.3 Where collected static files go for production: `STATIC_ROOT`\n",
    "Add:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / \"staticfiles\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- In production, you run `collectstatic`.\n",
    "- Django copies all static assets from apps + directories into `STATIC_ROOT`.\n",
    "- Then your web server (Nginx/CDN) serves from `STATIC_ROOT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:** `STATIC_ROOT` is usually *not* the same as your dev `static/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common professional layout:\n",
    "- `static/` → source assets you edit\n",
    "- `staticfiles/` → generated collection output\n",
    "\n",
    "You generally do not commit `staticfiles/` to git.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.3 How Django Finds Static Files (The Staticfiles Finders)\n",
    "\n",
    "When `django.contrib.staticfiles` is installed (it is by default), Django uses\n",
    "“finders” to locate static files in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `STATICFILES_DIRS`\n",
    "2. each installed app’s `static/` directory:\n",
    "   - `myapp/static/myapp/...`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example app static layout:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "articles/\n",
    "  static/\n",
    "    articles/\n",
    "      articles.css\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This mirrors the templates namespacing pattern. Namespacing avoids collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.4 Serving Static Files in Development\n",
    "\n",
    "With `DEBUG=True`, Django serves static files automatically when you run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py runserver\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only for development. In production, Django should not serve static files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify static\n",
    "Visit:\n",
    "- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/css/site.css`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see CSS content, your static setup works.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.5 `collectstatic` (What It Does and Why It Exists)\n",
    "\n",
    "Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py collectstatic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Django will copy static assets into `STATIC_ROOT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.5.1 Why production needs `collectstatic`\n",
    "In production, you often have:\n",
    "- static files in multiple apps\n",
    "- pipeline tools (bundlers, hashed filenames)\n",
    "- a web server that wants one directory to serve static from\n",
    "\n",
    "`collectstatic`:\n",
    "- collects everything into a single directory\n",
    "- optionally applies storage transformations (like hashed names) depending on storage backend\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.5.2 What you should not do\n",
    "Do not rely on Django’s dev static serving in production. It’s slower and not designed\n",
    "for high traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.6 Media Files Setup (Where Uploads Are Stored)\n",
    "\n",
    "Add to `config/settings.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MEDIA_URL = \"/media/\"\n",
    "MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / \"media\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- `MEDIA_ROOT` is the filesystem directory where uploaded files are stored.\n",
    "- `MEDIA_URL` is the URL prefix used to access them (in dev) or served by web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.6.1 Why media is not automatic like static\n",
    "Serving user uploads is a production decision:\n",
    "- public vs private\n",
    "- storage backend (local disk vs S3)\n",
    "- access control\n",
    "- caching and CDN behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "In dev, we serve them via Django for convenience, but production typically uses\n",
    "Nginx/S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.7 Serve Media in Development (Correct URL Wiring)\n",
    "\n",
    "In `config/urls.py`, add development-only media serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.contrib import admin\n",
    "from django.conf import settings\n",
    "from django.conf.urls.static import static\n",

    "    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- `static(...)` here is a helper to serve files during development.\n",
    "- Wrapping it in `if settings.DEBUG:` ensures it doesn’t run in production.\n",
    "- In production, you must serve media using a proper solution (later chapters).\n",
