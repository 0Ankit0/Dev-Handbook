    "\n",
    "Email is one of the most common “real-world” requirements in Django projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- password reset (already introduced)\n",
    "- account verification / welcome emails\n",
    "- alerts (“your article was published”)\n",
    "- invitations\n",
    "- billing receipts\n",
    "- system monitoring notifications\n",
    "- admin “contact us” submissions\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter teaches you email the way it’s done in real teams:\n",
    "- correct settings per environment\n",
    "- reliable templated emails (text + HTML)\n",
    "- link building (absolute URLs)\n",
    "- safe, testable sending\n",
    "- production deliverability basics\n",
    "- notification patterns (idempotency, “don’t spam users”)\n",
    "- how to keep email logic out of views (service layer)\n",

    "## 15.0 Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain how Django sends email and what an email backend is.\n",
    "2. Configure email correctly for:\n",
    "   - development (console/file backend)\n",
    "   - tests (locmem outbox)\n",
    "   - production (SMTP/provider)\n",
    "3. Send emails using:\n",
    "   - `send_mail`\n",
    "   - `EmailMessage`\n",
    "   - `EmailMultiAlternatives` (text + HTML)\n",
    "4. Build templated emails with `render_to_string` and reusable layouts.\n",
    "5. Build absolute URLs in emails reliably (with and without `request`).\n",
    "6. Implement a notification use-case in your app (article published email).\n",
    "7. Test emails using `django.core.mail.outbox`.\n",
    "8. Understand production concerns: deliverability, retries, background tasks.\n",

    "## 15.1 Email in Django: The Architecture (What Actually Happens)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.1.1 Django doesn’t “magically send email”\n",
    "Django provides:\n",
    "- API to construct messages\n",
    "- hooks to send through a **backend**\n",
    "- helpers to render templates\n",
    "\n",
    "But the actual sending is done by:\n",
    "- SMTP server you configure, or\n",
    "- provider API (via third-party package), or\n",
    "- dev/test backend that doesn’t really deliver\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.1.2 Email backend = “where send() goes”\n",
    "When you call `email.send()`, Django uses `settings.EMAIL_BACKEND`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common backends:\n",
    "- console backend (prints to terminal)\n",
    "- file backend (writes to disk)\n",
    "- locmem backend (keeps in memory for tests)\n",
    "- SMTP backend (real sending)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15.2 Configure Email Backends by Environment (Industry Standard)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.2.1 Development: console backend\n",
    "In `config/settings.py` (dev-only):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "EMAIL_BACKEND = \"django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend\"\n",
    "DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = \"Django Mastery <no-reply@example.com>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What you get:\n",
    "- emails print in your runserver terminal\n",
    "- no external setup\n",
    "- perfect for learning flows (password reset, publish notifications)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.2.2 Alternative dev backend: file backend (useful for “see HTML nicely”)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "EMAIL_BACKEND = \"django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend\"\n",
    "EMAIL_FILE_PATH = BASE_DIR / \"sent_emails\"\n",
    "DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = \"Django Mastery <no-reply@example.com>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This writes each email to a file. It’s great when you want to open the email body in\n",
    "an editor and inspect formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.2.3 Tests: locmem backend (Django’s standard)\n",
    "In tests, Django uses an in-memory backend so you can assert:\n",
    "\n",
    "- how many emails were sent\n",
    "- subject/body/to/from\n",
    "- HTML alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need to configure it manually for normal tests. You access the outbox via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.core import mail\n",
    "mail.outbox\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.2.4 Production: SMTP backend (most common baseline)\n",
    "In production, you usually set environment variables and configure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "EMAIL_BACKEND = \"django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend\"\n",
    "EMAIL_HOST = os.environ[\"EMAIL_HOST\"]\n",
    "EMAIL_PORT = int(os.environ.get(\"EMAIL_PORT\", \"587\"))\n",
    "EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get(\"EMAIL_HOST_USER\", \"\")\n",
    "EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get(\"EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD\", \"\")\n",
    "EMAIL_USE_TLS = os.environ.get(\"EMAIL_USE_TLS\", \"true\").lower() == \"true\"\n",
    "EMAIL_TIMEOUT = int(os.environ.get(\"EMAIL_TIMEOUT\", \"10\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get(\n",
    "    \"DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL\",\n",
    "    \"Django Mastery <no-reply@example.com>\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why env vars?**\n",
    "- credentials must not live in git\n",
    "- different environments use different servers\n",
    "- rotating keys/passwords should not require code changes\n",

    "## 15.3 Sending Email: The Three Main APIs (When to Use Which)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.3.1 `send_mail()` (quick and simple)\n",
    "Good for very simple emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.core.mail import send_mail\n",
    "from django.conf import settings\n",
    "\n",
    "send_mail(\n",
    "    subject=\"Welcome\",\n",
    "    message=\"Thanks for joining.\",\n",
    "    from_email=settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,\n",
    "    recipient_list=[\"user@example.com\"],\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- minimal code\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- less flexible (HTML alternative, attachments, headers are more awkward)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.3.2 `EmailMessage` (more control)\n",
    "Use when you want:\n",
    "- headers\n",
    "- reply-to\n",
    "- attachments\n",
    "- explicit control over content type\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.core.mail import EmailMessage\n",
    "from django.conf import settings\n",
    "\n",
    "email = EmailMessage(\n",
    "    subject=\"Support request received\",\n",
    "    body=\"We got your message and will reply soon.\",\n",
    "    from_email=settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,\n",
    "    to=[\"user@example.com\"],\n",
    "    reply_to=[\"support@example.com\"],\n",
    ")\n",
    "email.send()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.3.3 `EmailMultiAlternatives` (text + HTML)\n",
    "This is the professional standard for user-facing emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why you want both:\n",
    "- some clients prefer plain text\n",
    "- HTML version improves branding/UX\n",
    "- deliverability is often better with a text alternative\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.core.mail import EmailMultiAlternatives\n",
    "from django.conf import settings\n",
    "\n",

    "text_body = \"Your article is live.\"\n",
    "html_body = \"<p>Your article is <strong>live</strong>.</p>\"\n",

    "msg = EmailMultiAlternatives(\n",
    "    subject=subject,\n",
    "    body=text_body,\n",
    "    from_email=settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,\n",
    "    to=[\"user@example.com\"],\n",

    "## 15.4 Templated Emails (Industry Standard Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardcoding long email bodies in Python becomes unmaintainable quickly. The correct\n",
    "pattern is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create templates in `templates/emails/...`\n",
    "2. render them with context\n",

    "\n",
    "Even perfect code can “send” emails that never arrive. Deliverability depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SPF**: authorizes which servers can send mail for your domain\n",
    "2. **DKIM**: cryptographically signs email to prove authenticity\n",
    "3. **DMARC**: policy + reporting combining SPF/DKIM results\n",
    "4. **From address discipline**:\n",
    "   - sending from `no-reply@yourdomain.com` with proper DNS setup\n",
    "   - avoid random from addresses that don’t match your domain\n",
    "5. **Content**:\n",
    "   - avoid spammy phrases/links\n",
    "   - include text alternative\n",
    "6. **List hygiene**:\n",
    "   - handle bounces/complaints\n",
    "   - don’t keep sending to dead addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "In many companies, you’ll use transactional providers (SendGrid/Mailgun/Postmark/AWS\n",
    "SES). Django can talk to them via SMTP or provider-specific APIs (with packages).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 15.13.1 Transactional vs marketing (separate streams)\n",
    "- Transactional: password reset, verification, receipts (must deliver)\n",
    "- Marketing: newsletters (must support opt-out, compliance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t mix them:\n",
    "- different sender addresses/domains\n",
    "- different compliance requirements\n",
    "- different user expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.13.2 Idempotency (don’t double-send)\n",
    "You already implemented a publish transition check. More advanced patterns include:\n",
    "- storing “notification sent” timestamps in DB\n",
    "- unique constraints on “event id + user + type”\n",
    "- task queues with deduplication keys\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.13.3 Don’t block request/response on slow email in production\n",
    "SMTP/provider calls can be slow or fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Industry pattern:\n",
    "- enqueue email sending to a background worker (Celery/RQ)\n",
    "- retry on failures\n",

    "   - default True\n",
    "   - update `send_article_published_email` to respect the preference\n",

    "2. Add an email template for “Article updated” (but only send once per day per\n",
    "   user—design a strategy even if you don’t fully implement it).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Switch dev backend from console to file backend:\n",
    "   - send a contact email\n",
    "   - open the saved file and confirm the full email content\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add a unit test that asserts the HTML alternative exists:\n",
