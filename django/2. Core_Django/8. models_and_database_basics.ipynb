    "1. Explain how a Django model maps to a database table (fields → columns, rows → instances).\n",
    "2. Create models with appropriate field types and options.\n",
    "3. Create and apply migrations (`makemigrations`, `migrate`) and explain the difference.\n",
    "4. Understand primary keys (`id`) and `BigAutoField`.\n",
    "5. Create relationships:\n",
    "   - `ForeignKey` (one-to-many)\n",
    "   - `ManyToManyField` (many-to-many)\n",
    "   - `OneToOneField` (one-to-one)\n",
    "6. Use `Meta`, indexes, and constraints to enforce correctness at the database level.\n",
    "7. Understand validation vs constraints (application-level vs database-level).\n",
    "8. Use Django shell to create/query objects.\n",
    "9. Write model tests using `TestCase`.\n",

    "### 8.1.1 Tables, rows, columns (mapping to Django)\n",
    "Relational databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) store data in tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Table**: collection of records for a concept (e.g., `articles_article`)\n",
    "- **Row**: one record (e.g., one Article)\n",
    "- **Column**: one attribute (e.g., title, slug)\n",
    "\n",
    "Django mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model class (e.g., `Article`) → Table\n",
    "- Model instance (`Article(...)`) → Row\n",
    "- Model field (`title = models.CharField(...)`) → Column\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1.2 Primary keys (why every row needs an identity)\n",
    "Most tables have a **primary key** column, typically an integer `id` that uniquely\n",
    "identifies each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Django:\n",
    "- If you don’t define a primary key, Django creates one automatically (`id`).\n",
    "- Modern Django defaults to `BigAutoField` (64-bit integer) for scalability.\n",

    "### 8.2.1 SQLite (good for learning)\n",
    "SQLite is file-based:\n",
    "- simple setup (no server)\n",
    "- great for local dev and tutorials\n",

    "Limitations:\n",
    "- concurrency constraints (write locking)\n",
    "- fewer advanced features than PostgreSQL\n",

    "### 8.2.2 PostgreSQL (industry standard for Django production)\n",
    "Most serious Django deployments use PostgreSQL because:\n",
    "- robust concurrency\n",
    "- advanced indexing and query planning\n",
    "- strong integrity features\n",
    "- JSON fields, full-text search, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "A Django model is a Python class that:\n",

    "- provides query API via the ORM\n",
    "- can include behavior (methods)\n",
    "- participates in validation and constraints\n",

    "- `Article` model\n",
    "- Many-to-many relationship: Article ↔ Tag\n",

    "If tags are just strings embedded everywhere:\n",
    "- you can’t easily enforce uniqueness (“Django” vs “django” duplicates)\n",
    "- you can’t rename a tag safely\n",
    "- you can’t query “all articles tagged X” efficiently without full scans\n",

    "### 8.5.1 Field-by-field explanation (what each does and why)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `CharField` vs `TextField`\n",
    "- `CharField(max_length=...)` is for reasonably short strings (titles, names).\n",
    "  - `max_length` is required and used by DB/schema and forms.\n",
    "- `TextField()` is for long text (article body).\n",
    "  - no `max_length` enforced at DB-level by default (you can validate in forms).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `SlugField`\n",
    "A slug is a URL-friendly identifier: lowercase, hyphens, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why store `slug`?\n",
    "- human-readable URLs: `/articles/hello-django/`\n",
    "- stable identifiers for content\n",
    "- avoids exposing numeric IDs in public URLs (not a security feature, but often nicer UX)\n",
    "\n",
    "We set `unique=True` so two articles can’t share the same slug.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `choices` with `TextChoices` (professional pattern)\n",
    "Using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Status(models.TextChoices):\n",
    "    DRAFT = \"draft\", \"Draft\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "gives:\n",
    "- database stores stable values (`draft`, `published`)\n",
    "- UI displays human labels (“Draft”)\n",
    "- code is less error-prone than random strings\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll later use:\n",
    "- `Article.Status.PUBLISHED`\n",
    "instead of `\"published\"` scattered everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `null=True` vs `blank=True` (critical distinction)\n",
    "- `null=True` affects the database column: it can store NULL.\n",
    "- `blank=True` affects validation/forms: it can be empty in user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common rule:\n",
    "- For text fields, prefer `blank=True` and keep `null=False` (empty string instead of NULL).\n",
    "- For dates/foreign keys, `null=True` is common if optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- `published_at` is optional → `null=True, blank=True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `ManyToManyField(Tag, related_name=\"articles\")`\n",
    "This creates a join table automatically (something like `articles_article_tags`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `related_name=\"articles\"` means:\n",
    "  - from a Tag instance, you can access `tag.articles.all()` to get all articles.\n",
    "- `blank=True` means:\n",
    "  - an article can be saved with no tags (common and convenient).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `auto_now=True` vs `default=timezone.now`\n",
    "- `created_at = DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)`:\n",
    "  - set once at creation time\n",
    "  - remains stable\n",
    "- `updated_at = DateTimeField(auto_now=True)`:\n",
    "  - updates every time you save the model\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very common industry pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexes\n",
    "Indexes speed up queries at the cost of storage and slower writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We added:\n",
    "- `Index(fields=[\"slug\"])` because we often query by slug in detail pages.\n",
    "- `Index(fields=[\"status\", \"-created_at\"])` because list pages often filter by status and order by recency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints (data integrity at DB level)\n",
    "We added a check:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If status is `\"published\"`, then `published_at` must not be NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters:\n",
    "- Without it, your app could accidentally mark something published without timestamp.\n",
    "- Constraints protect integrity even if data is created/modified outside your view logic.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 8.6.1 What a migration is\n",
    "A migration is a versioned, replayable set of operations:\n",
    "- create table\n",
    "- add column\n",
    "- alter column\n",
    "- create index\n",
    "- add constraint\n",
    "- etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 8.6.2 `makemigrations` vs `migrate` (must understand)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `python manage.py makemigrations`\n",
    "  - compares your models to existing migration state\n",
    "  - generates migration files (`articles/migrations/0001_initial.py`)\n",
    "  - does NOT change the database\n",
    "\n",
    "- `python manage.py migrate`\n",
    "  - applies migrations to the database\n",
    "  - changes schema (creates tables, columns, constraints)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.6.3 Create migrations\n",
    "Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py makemigrations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see output like:\n",
    "- `Create model Tag`\n",
    "- `Create model Article`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py migrate\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 8.6.4 Inspect generated SQL (very useful debugging skill)\n",
    "Find the migration name Django created (e.g., `0001_initial`) and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py sqlmigrate articles 0001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This prints the SQL that Django will run (or ran).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters:\n",
    "- helps you understand what schema is being created\n",
    "- helps debug constraints/indexes\n",

    "Django can validate model fields when you call:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "article.full_clean()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But Django does **not** automatically run `full_clean()` on every `save()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where validation typically runs:\n",
    "- Django Forms / ModelForms (when you build web forms)\n",
    "- DRF serializers (for APIs)\n",
    "- explicit `full_clean()` in service logic (optional, case-dependent)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.10.2 Constraints (database layer)\n",
    "Constraints (like `unique=True`, CheckConstraint) are enforced by the DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why constraints matter:\n",
    "- they protect you even if data is created by:\n",
    "  - scripts\n",
    "  - admin mistakes\n",
    "  - management commands\n",
    "  - concurrent requests\n",

    "## 8.11 Relationship Types (ForeignKey, OneToOne, ManyToMany) — With Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.11.1 ForeignKey (one-to-many)\n",
    "Example: Many articles belong to one author.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Django’s built-in User model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.conf import settings\n",
    "\n",
    "author = models.ForeignKey(\n",
    "    settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,\n",
    "    on_delete=models.PROTECT,\n",
    "    related_name=\"articles\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- Many Article rows can point to one User row.\n",
    "- `on_delete=models.PROTECT` prevents deleting a user who still has articles (good\n",
    "  for preserving authored content).\n",
    "- `related_name=\"articles\"` allows `user.articles.all()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.11.2 OneToOne (one-to-one)\n",
    "Example: user profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "profile = models.OneToOneField(\n",
    "    settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,\n",
    "    on_delete=models.CASCADE,\n",
    "    related_name=\"profile\",\n",

    "\n",
    "Meaning:\n",
    "- each user has at most one profile row\n",
    "- profile belongs to exactly one user\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.11.3 ManyToMany (many-to-many)\n",
    "We already used it for tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood:\n",
    "- a join table stores pairs (article_id, tag_id)\n",

    "Professional approach:\n",
    "- create new migrations to modify schema; don’t rewrite history unless you know\n",

    "\n",
    "### Mistake C: Circular dependencies across apps\n",
    "Happens when two apps reference each other in models.\n",
    "Fix patterns:\n",
    "- use `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` for user references\n",
    "- use string references `\"app.ModelName\"`\n",
