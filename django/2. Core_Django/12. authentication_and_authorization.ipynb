    "\n",
    "This chapter upgrades your app from “anyone can create/edit content” to an\n",
    "industry-standard, secure workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- users can log in and log out\n",
    "- create/edit actions require authentication\n",
    "- edits are limited to authorized users (ownership + permissions)\n",
    "- you understand where login state lives (sessions)\n",
    "- you can build password reset flows (dev-friendly, production-ready structure)\n",
    "- you can test auth-protected views properly\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Django’s built-in auth system first (industry standard), then layer your\n",

    "## 12.0 Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain **authentication** vs **authorization** clearly.\n",
    "2. Explain how Django auth works internally at a practical level:\n",
    "   - sessions + cookies\n",
    "   - `AuthenticationMiddleware` + `request.user`\n",
    "3. Use Django’s built-in auth views (login/logout/password reset).\n",
    "4. Protect views with:\n",
    "   - `@login_required`\n",
    "   - `@permission_required` (where appropriate)\n",
    "5. Implement **object-level authorization** (ownership rules):\n",
    "   - only authors (or staff) can edit/delete an article\n",
    "6. Add an `author` field to your `Article` model correctly (with migrations).\n",
    "7. Use `commit=False` + `save_m2m()` correctly in create/edit.\n",
    "8. Configure redirect behavior (`next` parameter, login redirect).\n",
    "9. Assign permissions and groups in Django admin.\n",
    "10. Write tests verifying:\n",
    "   - anonymous users are redirected to login\n",
    "   - logged-in users can create/edit\n",
    "   - unauthorized users are denied\n",

    "## 12.1 Authentication vs Authorization (Do Not Mix These)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication: “Who are you?”\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- user enters username/password → system verifies → session created\n",
    "- request has `request.user` = that user\n",

    "### Authorization: “Are you allowed to do this?”\n",

    "## 12.2 How Django Auth Works (Practical Architecture)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.2.1 Middleware is the key\n",
    "Two middleware classes make “logged-in state” work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SessionMiddleware`:\n",
    "  - loads session data using the session cookie (usually `sessionid`)\n",
    "- `AuthenticationMiddleware`:\n",
    "  - uses session data to populate `request.user`\n",
    "\n",
    "If these middleware are missing or out of order, `request.user` won’t behave\n",
    "correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `config/settings.py`, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MIDDLEWARE = [\n",
    "    \"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n",
    "    # (your timing middleware if you kept it)\n",
    "    \"django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware\",\n",

    "\n",
    "### 12.2.2 Where login state lives\n",
    "- Browser stores a cookie (session id).\n",
    "- Server stores session data (DB by default in Django, unless configured otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "So “logged in” typically means:\n",
    "- session cookie exists\n",
    "- session maps to user id\n",
    "- `request.user` is set on each request\n",

    "## 12.3 Add Auth URLs (Login/Logout/Password Reset) the Standard Way\n",
    "\n",
    "Django ships built-in auth views and URL patterns. The industry-standard approach\n",
    "is to include them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit `config/urls.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.contrib import admin\n",
    "from django.urls import include, path\n",
    "\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    path(\"admin/\", admin.site.urls),\n",
    "    path(\"\", include(\"pages.urls\")),\n",
    "    path(\"articles/\", include(\"articles.urls\")),\n",
    "    path(\"accounts/\", include(\"django.contrib.auth.urls\")),\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What routes you just added\n",
    "Including `django.contrib.auth.urls` gives you named routes like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `/accounts/login/` (name: `login`)\n",
    "- `/accounts/logout/` (name: `logout`)\n",
    "- `/accounts/password_change/`\n",
    "- `/accounts/password_reset/`\n",
    "- etc.\n",

    "You can see them in Django docs, but you don’t need to memorize all—just remember:\n",
    "**include auth URLs once**, then override templates as needed.\n",

    "## 12.4 Create Login/Logout Templates (Django Looks for Specific Names)\n",
    "\n",
    "Django’s built-in auth views expect templates at specific paths. The most important\n",
    "one is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `registration/login.html`\n",
    "\n",
    "Create:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",

    "  registration/\n",
    "    login.html\n",
    "    logged_out.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.4.1 `templates/registration/login.html`\n",

    "```text\n",

    "#### What `@login_required` actually does\n",
    "If the user is not authenticated:\n",
    "- Django returns a 302 redirect to the login URL\n",
    "- includes `?next=...` so user returns after logging in\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.7 Configure Login Redirect Behavior (Optional but Common)\n",
    "\n",
    "Django uses `settings.LOGIN_URL` to know where to send users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you included auth URLs at `/accounts/`, the login URL is `/accounts/login/`.\n",
    "Django usually finds it, but it’s best to be explicit in professional projects.\n",

    "- reduces duplicated redirect logic\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.8 Object-Level Authorization (Ownership): Add `author` to Article\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication alone is not enough. You need rules like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only the author can edit/delete their own article\n",
    "- Staff/admin can edit any article\n",

    "This requires an ownership field.\n",

    "Edit `articles/models.py`:\n",

    "It supports:\n",
    "- default User model now\n",
    "- custom user model later without rewriting relations\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Why `null=True` initially (migration safety)\n",
    "Because you already have existing Article rows in your DB.\n",
    "If you add a non-null FK, Django will ask for a default to fill existing rows.\n",

    "- `articles.view_article`\n",

    "### 12.13.1 When to use permissions vs ownership checks\n",
    "- Ownership checks are object-level (this specific article).\n",
    "- Permissions are role-level (this kind of action in general).\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional pattern:\n",
    "- Use permissions for broad capabilities (editors can edit articles).\n",
    "- Use ownership for “only modify your own things.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you combine them:\n",
    "- allow edit if user has `change_article` OR user is owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.13.2 Enforce permission in a view (optional pattern)\n",
    "```python\n",

    "1. Go to **Groups**\n",

    "   - lists only `Article.objects.filter(author=request.user)`\n",
    "   - show it in nav only if logged in\n",

    "3. Add permission-based creation:\n",
    "   - require `articles.add_article` permission to access create\n",
    "   - create an “Editors” group and assign the permission\n",
    "   - test that a normal user gets 403, editor can create\n",

    "- Implement object ownership using an `author` FK and enforce edit/delete rules.\n",
    "- Use `commit=False` + `save_m2m()` when setting fields like author programmatically.\n",
