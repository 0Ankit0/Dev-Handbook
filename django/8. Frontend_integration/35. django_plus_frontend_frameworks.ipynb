    "## 35. Django + SPA / Frontend Frameworks (React/Vue/Next) — Real‑Team Architecture, Auth, CORS/CSRF, Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter answers the questions that decide whether your Django project stays\n",
    "pleasant as the frontend grows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Should you build **server-rendered Django templates** or a **separate SPA**?\n",
    "- If SPA: cookie sessions or JWT? Where do tokens live?\n",
    "- If split frontend/backend: how do **CORS** and **CSRF** work *correctly*?\n",
    "- How do you deploy it without fragile hacks?\n",
    "- How do you structure code and routes so teams can collaborate without breaking\n",
    "  each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll cover both industry-common setups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Monolith**: Django serves HTML and maybe small JS enhancements  \n",
    "2) **Hybrid**: Django serves templates + uses HTMX or “sprinkles”  \n",
    "3) **Split**: frontend (React/Vue/Next) is separate; Django exposes APIs (DRF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we’ll implement two full auth patterns you’ll see in production:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cookie session + CSRF** (often best for same-site web apps and internal tools)\n",
    "- **JWT (access + refresh)** (common for mobile + SPAs, but higher complexity)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 35.0 Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose an architecture: monolith vs split, and justify it.\n",
    "2. Set up a Django + DRF backend that supports a SPA frontend safely.\n",
    "3. Implement one of these auth strategies correctly:\n",
    "   - **Cookie session auth + CSRF**\n",
    "   - **Token/JWT auth** (bearer tokens, refresh tokens)\n",
    "4. Configure CORS and CSRF trusted origins properly (no dangerous wildcard setups).\n",
    "5. Deploy a frontend + backend cleanly (reverse proxy routing, static builds).\n",
    "6. Design API routes and frontend routes that don’t conflict.\n",
    "7. Know the “gotchas” and how to test them.\n",

    "## 35.1 Architecture Options (What Real Teams Choose)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35.1.1 Option A — Django templates (server-rendered) + minimal JS\n",
    "**Best for:**\n",
    "- content sites, admin-heavy tools, internal apps\n",
    "- teams that want simplicity and fast delivery\n",
    "- SEO-heavy pages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- simplest security model (cookies + CSRF)\n",
    "- fewer moving parts (one codebase, one deploy)\n",
    "- Django forms/admin shine\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- very complex client-side UI can feel clunky\n",
    "- if you need offline-first or heavy client state, you may fight templates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35.1.2 Option B — Django + HTMX (hybrid)\n",
    "**Best for:**\n",
    "- CRUD apps that want interactivity without SPA complexity\n",
    "- teams that like server-rendered HTML but want responsiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- keeps Django strengths\n",
    "- avoids building a full frontend build pipeline (or keeps it minimal)\n",
    "- progressive enhancement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- still not ideal for highly complex client-side experiences\n",
    "- you must manage partial templates carefully\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35.1.3 Option C — Split frontend (React/Vue/Next) + DRF API\n",
    "**Best for:**\n",
    "- mobile apps + web app sharing the same backend\n",
    "- teams with dedicated frontend engineers\n",
    "- heavy UI, complex interactions\n",
    "- microservices/platform teams\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- clean separation of concerns\n",
    "- frontend can move fast with its own tooling and release cycle\n",
    "- reusable API for multiple clients\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- hardest security configuration (CORS/CSRF, token storage)\n",
    "- more infrastructure: two builds, two deploys, version coordination\n",
    "- more ways to break user sessions with misconfiguration\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 35.2 Decision Matrix (Practical)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this as a real “architecture meeting” tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choose server-rendered Django (templates/HTMX) if:\n",
    "- you mainly build forms + lists + dashboards\n",
    "- SEO matters and you want it easy\n",
    "- you want simplest auth model\n",
    "- your team is backend-heavy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choose split SPA + DRF if:\n",
    "- you need a rich client UI that is hard in templates\n",
    "- you have multiple clients (mobile + web)\n",
    "- you have a frontend team and want a modern frontend stack\n",
    "- you need to share UI components and state management patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry reality:** Many companies start with Django templates/HTMX and move to\n",
    "SPA for selected parts later. You don’t have to choose one forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 35.3 Route Design: Keep Frontend Routes and API Routes Separate\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- API: `/api/v1/...`\n",
    "- Auth API: `/api/v1/auth/...`\n",
    "- HTML pages (if any): `/...`\n",
    "- Frontend SPA routes: handled by the frontend router (e.g., `/app/...`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- `/api/v1/articles/` → DRF\n",
    "- `/api/v1/orgs/acme/tasks/` → DRF\n",
    "- `/admin/` → Django admin\n",
    "- `/app/` → SPA entrypoint (index.html), SPA router handles deeper paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters:\n",
    "- prevents “Django 404 vs SPA 404” confusion\n",
    "- makes caching, security headers, and logging clearer\n",
    "- keeps reverse proxy routing simple\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 35.4 Deployment Topologies (Industry Standard)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35.4.1 Topology 1 — Same domain, reverse proxy routes `/api` to Django\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- `https://example.com/app/` → frontend static\n",
    "- `https://example.com/api/` → Django (DRF)\n",
    "- `https://example.com/admin/` → Django\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the cleanest for **cookies + CSRF** because it’s same-site:\n",
    "- fewer CORS problems\n",
    "- cookies behave predictably\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35.4.2 Topology 2 — Separate subdomains\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- frontend: `https://app.example.com`\n",
    "- backend: `https://api.example.com`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you must manage:\n",
    "- CORS (browser needs permission to read responses)\n",
    "- cookies across subdomains (if using cookie auth)\n",
    "- CSRF trusted origins\n",
    "\n",
    "This is common, but it’s where most misconfig happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35.4.3 Topology 3 — Entirely separate hosts\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- frontend: Vercel/Netlify\n",
    "- backend: Render/Fly/VPS/K8s\n",
    "\n",
    "Also common. Same issues as subdomains, plus:\n",
    "- different deploy pipelines\n",
    "- separate environments and secrets\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 35.5 Auth Strategy #1 (Recommended for Same-Site SPA): Cookie Session + CSRF\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the “Django-native” approach and works beautifully when:\n",
    "- frontend and backend are same-site (same domain)\n",
    "- you can rely on secure cookies\n",
    "- you want easy logout/revocation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35.5.1 How it works (exactly)\n",
    "- User logs in (via Django session auth).\n",
    "- Browser stores `sessionid` cookie (HttpOnly).\n",
    "- SPA requests include cookies automatically (with `credentials: \"include\"` or\n",
    "  same-origin default).\n",
    "- Unsafe requests (POST/PATCH/DELETE) must include CSRF token.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35.5.2 DRF configuration\n",
    "In `config/settings.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "REST_FRAMEWORK = {\n",
    "    \"DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES\": [\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 35.5.3 Provide an endpoint that sets CSRF cookie for SPA\n",
    "SPAs often need a way to “bootstrap” CSRF token.\n",

    "Create `pages/views_csrf.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.http import JsonResponse\n",

    "- CORS is about allowing browser JS to read responses; CSRF is about preventing\n",
    "  cookie-auth state changes from other sites. They solve different problems.\n",
    "- Deployment should keep routes clean (`/api/v1/`, `/app/`, `/admin/`) and avoid\n",
