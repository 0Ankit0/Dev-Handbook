    "- query slows down as table grows\n",
    "- `explain()` shows sequential scan on large table\n",

    "\n",
    "Caching is about storing computed results so you don\u2019t recompute every request.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Django, common cache layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. per-view caching (cache entire response)\n",
    "2. template fragment caching (cache part of a page)\n",
    "3. low-level caching (cache computed data in code)\n",

    "- local memory (not shared across processes; dev only)\n",
    "- Redis/Memcached (production standard)\n",

    "---\n",

    "```\n",

    "In `articles/views.py`:\n",

    "#### Explanation\n",
    "- The entire response for a given URL (including query string) is cached for 60 seconds.\n",
    "- That means:\n",
    "  - `/articles/?tag=django` is a different cache entry than `/articles/?tag=cbv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important warning (auth-related)\n",
    "Do not cache pages that include user-specific content unless you vary cache keys by user or avoid caching.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose your sidebar shows \u201cTop tags\u201d computed by an annotated query. You can cache that fragment.\n",

    "return render(..., {\"top_tags\": top_tags, ...})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.10.2 Cache fragment in template\n",
    "In your template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```django\n",
    "{% load cache %}\n",
    "\n",
    "{% cache 300 top_tags %}\n",

    "#### Explanation: what the `{% cache %}` tag does\n",
    "- caches rendered HTML of that block for 300 seconds\n",
    "- key is `top_tags` (plus template context variation rules)\n",
    "- reduces DB work and template rendering work\n",
    "\n",
