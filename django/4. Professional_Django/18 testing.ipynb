    "## 18. Testing (Unit, Integration, E2E) — Industry-Grade Strategy + Hands-On\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter turns “I have some tests” into “I can ship changes confidently.”\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll learn how professional Django teams test:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unit tests** for pure logic (fast, isolated, tons of coverage)\n",
    "- **Integration tests** for Django views/ORM/forms (the backbone of web apps)\n",
    "- **End-to-end (E2E) tests** for critical user journeys (few, expensive, high value)\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll also learn how to keep tests:\n",
    "- readable\n",
    "- fast\n",
    "- deterministic\n",
    "- resistant to refactors\n",
    "- useful for preventing regressions (including performance regressions like N+1)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 18.0 Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain the **test pyramid** and apply it to Django projects.\n",
    "2. Choose what to test at each level: unit vs integration vs E2E.\n",
    "3. Write robust Django tests using:\n",
    "   - `TestCase` + Django test client\n",
    "   - pytest + pytest-django (recommended in many teams)\n",
    "4. Use factories (factory_boy) instead of brittle fixtures.\n",
    "5. Mock external services (email, HTTP APIs) safely.\n",
    "6. Test authorization and scoping (multi-tenant/org apps) correctly.\n",
    "7. Prevent performance regressions using query-count tests (`assertNumQueries`).\n",
    "8. Run tests like CI does (lint + format check + tests + coverage).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 18.1 The Test Pyramid (How Many Tests of Each Type)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.1.1 The pyramid\n",
    "- **Unit tests** (many): pure functions/classes, no DB, no Django request cycle\n",
    "- **Integration tests** (some): Django views/forms/models/ORM, DB used\n",
    "- **E2E tests** (few): real browser flows or near-real flows\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this is standard:\n",
    "- Unit tests are fast and pinpoint failures.\n",
    "- Integration tests prove framework wiring works.\n",
    "- E2E tests catch “it breaks in the browser” issues but are slow and flaky if overused.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.1.2 What you should NOT test (common waste)\n",
    "- “Django renders a template correctly” at pixel level\n",
    "- third-party library internals (unless you wrap them)\n",
    "- simple boilerplate lines\n",
    "- admin UI details (unless you added critical custom logic)\n",
    "\n",
    "You test *your behavior*, not Django’s behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 18.2 Django’s Built-in Test System vs pytest (Industry Reality)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can test Django in two popular ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option A: Django `TestCase` (unittest style)\n",
    "- Comes with Django, no extra packages\n",
    "- Great and widely used\n",
    "- A bit more verbose\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B (common in industry): pytest + pytest-django\n",
    "- Cleaner syntax\n",
    "- Powerful fixtures\n",
    "- Better parametrization\n",
    "- Huge ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "Many teams use pytest for everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter shows both, but strongly encourages pytest-django once you’re comfortable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 18.3 Baseline Test Rules (Make Tests Reliable)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 1: Tests must be deterministic\n",
    "No randomness without seeding, no reliance on current time unless frozen, no external network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 2: Each test should arrange-act-assert\n",
    "- Arrange: create data\n",
    "- Act: call function/view\n",
    "- Assert: check results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 3: Avoid “magic global state”\n",
    "If tests pass alone but fail when run together, you likely have hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 4: Keep tests readable\n",
    "A test is documentation. If it’s unreadable, it won’t be maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 18.4 Project Test Structure (Recommended Layout)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 1: tests inside apps (Django default)\n",
    "- `articles/tests.py`\n",
    "- `tasks/tests.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: close to code.  \n",
    "Cons: can become large messy files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 2 (common in bigger projects): separate `tests/` package\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "tests/\n",
    "  test_articles_views.py\n",
    "  test_tasks_permissions.py\n",
    "  factories.py\n",
    "  conftest.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: easy to organize by behavior.  \n",
    "Cons: need discipline to keep mapping clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either is fine. For “industry standard,” many teams prefer a `tests/` directory plus\n",
    "factories in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 18.5 Install the “Professional Testing Stack” (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re staying with Django TestCase only, you can skip this section. If you want\n",
