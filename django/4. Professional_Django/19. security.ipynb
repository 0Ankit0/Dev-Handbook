    "1. Explain Django\u2019s main threat areas using OWASP categories (CSRF, XSS, auth,\n",
    "   injection, insecure config, sensitive data exposure, broken access control).\n",

    "   - `DEBUG=False`, correct `ALLOWED_HOSTS`\n",
    "   - secure cookies and session settings\n",
    "   - HTTPS/HSTS settings (with proxy considerations)\n",
    "   - CSRF trusted origins for modern deployments\n",
    "3. Implement safe patterns for:\n",
    "   - CSRF protection in forms and AJAX\n",
    "   - XSS prevention and safe HTML rendering\n",
    "   - SQL injection prevention (ORM + safe raw SQL)\n",
    "4. Secure file uploads (size/type/path, private media concept).\n",
    "5. Add security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, Referrer-Policy, etc.).\n",
    "6. Add rate limiting/throttling conceptually (and know where Django ends and extra\n",
    "   tooling begins).\n",
    "7. Write tests that validate critical security behaviors:\n",
    "   - CSRF rejects missing token\n",
    "   - security headers exist (when configured)\n",

    "## 19.3 Secrets Management: `SECRET_KEY` and Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.3.1 What `SECRET_KEY` does\n",
    "Django uses `SECRET_KEY` for cryptographic signing (examples):\n",
    "- session cookies (when using signed cookies)\n",
    "- password reset tokens\n",
    "- CSRF token generation/signing aspects\n",
    "- signing utilities (`django.core.signing`)\n",

    "- forge signed values\n",
    "- compromise reset tokens\n",
    "- undermine trust boundaries\n",

    "### 19.3.2 Industry standard: do not store secrets in code\n",
    "Instead, use environment variables.\n",

    "In `config/settings.py` (or a dedicated settings module later):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "SECRET_KEY = os.environ[\"DJANGO_SECRET_KEY\"]\n",

    "Common patterns:\n",
    "- `.env` file (not committed) + a loader package (optional)\n",
    "- export env vars in your shell\n",

    "In production, `DEBUG=True` can expose:\n",
    "- detailed stack traces\n",
    "- environment variables\n",
    "- settings values\n",
    "- installed apps\n",

    "## 19.5 `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and Host Header Attacks (Often Missed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.5.1 What is the Host header?\n",
    "The client sends:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Host: example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Django uses it for:\n",
    "- building absolute URLs in some contexts\n",
    "- security decisions (when configured)\n",
    "- determining which site is being accessed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.5.2 What\u2019s the attack?\n",
    "If `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is misconfigured (too permissive), an attacker can send:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Host: evil.com\n",
    "```\n",

    "- cache poisoning\n",
    "- password reset links generated with attacker-controlled host (in some setups)\n",

    "## 19.6 HTTPS, Proxies, and \u201cWhy It Works Locally But Breaks in Production\u201d\n",
    "\n",
    "Most production Django apps run behind a reverse proxy/load balancer that terminates\n",
    "TLS. Django receives plain HTTP from the proxy even though the user used HTTPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.6.1 Enforcing HTTPS\n",
    "Typical settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning:\n",
    "- if request is not secure, redirect to HTTPS\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.6.2 Proxy header configuration\n",
    "If TLS is terminated upstream, Django needs to know the original scheme. Many setups\n",
    "use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = (\"HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO\", \"https\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells Django:\n",
    "- treat request as secure when the proxy set `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Only set this if your proxy reliably sets that header and you trust\n",
    "it. Otherwise attackers could spoof it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.6.3 HSTS (Strict Transport Security)\n",
    "HSTS tells browsers \u201calways use HTTPS for this domain.\u201d\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000  # 1 year\n",
    "SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True\n",
    "SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry caution:** start with a smaller value (e.g., 1 day) during rollout, then\n",
    "increase. HSTS can lock you into HTTPS\u2014good, but you must be ready.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19.7 Cookies and Session Security (High Impact, Low Effort)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your app uses sessions for authentication. Sessions ride on cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.7.1 Key session/csrf cookie settings (production)\n",
    "Typical baseline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True\n",
    "SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True\n",
    "SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = \"Lax\"\n",
    "\n",
    "CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True\n",
    "CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE = \"Lax\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain each:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HttpOnly` prevents JavaScript from reading the session cookie (reduces impact of XSS).\n",
    "- `Secure` ensures cookies are sent only over HTTPS (prevents leakage over HTTP).\n",
    "- `SameSite=Lax` reduces CSRF risk for many common flows while keeping normal\n",
    "  navigation functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.7.2 Session lifetime\n",
    "Default session age might be long. You can tune:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "SESSION_COOKIE_AGE = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7  # 7 days\n",
    "SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For highly sensitive apps, reduce age and consider idle timeouts (more advanced).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.7.3 CSRF cookie HttpOnly?\n",
    "By default, CSRF cookie is often readable by JS because some architectures read it\n",
    "to set AJAX headers. If you don\u2019t need JS to read it, you can tighten it, but only\n",
    "after understanding your frontend needs.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 19.8 CSRF (Cross\u2011Site Request Forgery) \u2014 Deep, Practical, Django\u2011Specific\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.8.1 The real risk in Django apps\n",
    "If you rely on cookie-based auth (session), your browser automatically sends those\n",
    "cookies with requests. That is what enables CSRF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.8.2 Django\u2019s protection model\n",
    "Django\u2019s CSRF middleware:\n",
    "- sets a CSRF cookie (token)\n",
    "- expects the token to be present in unsafe requests (usually in form body)\n",
    "- validates token matches expected value\n",
    "- blocks if missing/invalid (403)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.8.3 Correct usage in HTML forms\n",
    "Every POST form must include:\n",
    "\n",
    "```django\n",
    "<form method=\"post\">\n",
    "  {% csrf_token %}\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "</form>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.8.4 Correct usage for AJAX / fetch (common pattern)\n",
    "If you make POST requests using JavaScript, include `X-CSRFToken` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical approach:\n",
    "1. Read CSRF token from cookie (or from DOM).\n",
    "2. Send it in header.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript example (classic approach):\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function getCookie(name) {\n",
    "  const parts = document.cookie.split(\";\").map((c) => c.trim());\n",

    "    method: \"POST\",\n",
    "    headers: {\n",

    "    credentials: \"same-origin\",\n",
    "  });\n",
    "  return res.json();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Important notes:\n",
    "- `credentials: \"same-origin\"` ensures cookies are sent (needed for session auth).\n",
    "- CSRF token header must be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.8.5 CSRF + modern deployments: `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`\n",
    "If your site is served from multiple origins (e.g., behind a CDN, or using\n",
    "`https://app.example.com` + `https://api.example.com`), you often must configure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [\n",
    "    \"https://example.com\",\n",
    "    \"https://www.example.com\",\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is commonly required when:\n",
    "- your reverse proxy changes host/origin behavior\n",
    "- you use HTTPS and strict origin checks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.8.6 Testing CSRF correctly (so you know you didn\u2019t disable it)\n",
    "Django\u2019s test client disables CSRF checks by default. To test CSRF, you must enable\n",
    "checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create `tests/test_csrf.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.test import Client, TestCase\n",
    "from django.urls import reverse\n",

    "\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 403)\n",
