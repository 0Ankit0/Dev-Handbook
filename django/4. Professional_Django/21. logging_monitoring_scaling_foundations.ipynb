    "- **Monitoring/Metrics**: how often, how long, how many errors\n",
    "- **Tracing** (conceptual + practical hooks): where time is spent across services\n",
    "- **Error tracking**: capture exceptions with context (request id, user, endpoint)\n",
    "- **Health checks**: tell load balancers and orchestrators if your app is alive/ready\n",

    "1. Configure Python/Django logging properly (not `print`).\n",
    "2. Use structured, context-rich logs (request id, user id, path, method).\n",
    "3. Add middleware that logs request/response summaries with timing.\n",
    "4. Separate log levels:\n",
    "   - DEBUG (dev)\n",
    "   - INFO (normal ops)\n",
    "   - WARNING/ERROR (problems)\n",
    "5. Implement:\n",

    "6. Understand metrics you should monitor:\n",
    "   - request latency, error rate, throughput\n",
    "   - DB query time, cache hit rate\n",
    "7. Understand how error tracking tools work (Sentry concepts) and what to capture.\n",

    "- status code\n",
    "- duration\n",
    "- user id (if authenticated)\n",
