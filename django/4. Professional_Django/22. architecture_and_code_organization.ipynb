    "\n",
    "As Django projects grow, most pain comes from **architecture drift**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- views become huge (\u201cfat views\u201d)\n",
    "- models accumulate unrelated logic (\u201cfat models\u201d)\n",
    "- permissions are duplicated and inconsistent\n",
    "- query logic is scattered and unoptimized\n",
    "- forms/validation rules are repeated\n",
    "- settings become a \u201cbig ball of mud\u201d\n",
    "- import cycles appear\n",
    "- tests become slow and hard to maintain\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter gives you an industry-standard structure that stays maintainable from:\n",
    "- 1 app / 10 endpoints\n",
    "to\n",
    "- 20 apps / 200 endpoints / multiple developers.\n",

    "## 22.0 Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define clean boundaries between:\n",
    "   - views (HTTP boundary)\n",
    "   - forms/serializers (input validation boundary)\n",
    "   - selectors (read/query layer)\n",
    "   - services (write/business logic layer)\n",
    "   - domain rules (permissions/policies)\n",
    "2. Avoid \u201cfat views\u201d and \u201cfat models\u201d while still using Django idiomatically.\n",
    "3. Organize apps into maintainable modules:\n",
    "   - `selectors.py`, `services.py`, `permissions.py`, `types.py`\n",
    "4. Apply dependency inversion lightly (to keep code testable without overengineering).\n",
    "5. Structure settings cleanly (base/dev/prod), and keep secrets out of code.\n",
    "6. Create reusable internal packages and prevent circular imports.\n",
    "7. Enforce architecture with conventions and tests.\n",

    "A good Django architecture should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make the \u201chappy path\u201d easy to implement quickly.\n",
    "- Make bugs hard to introduce (centralized rules).\n",
    "- Make changes safe (refactors don\u2019t break random places).\n",
    "- Make performance predictable (queries not scattered).\n",
    "- Make testing easy (pure logic isolated from HTTP and DB where possible).\n",

    "A common industry mantra:\n",

    "- Keep your \u201cweb boundary\u201d thin.\n",

    "### Anti-pattern A: Fat views\n",
    "Symptoms:\n",
    "- a single view function does parsing + validation + querying + permissions + saving\n",
    "  + emailing + logging + branching\n",
    "- you can\u2019t reuse logic from admin, management commands, APIs\n",

    "  - API calls\n",
    "  - unrelated workflows\n",

    "Result:\n",
    "- hard to reason about side effects\n",
    "- unexpected behavior from \u201cjust saving a model\u201d\n",
    "- circular import pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anti-pattern C: \u201cRules live in templates/UI\u201d\n",
    "Symptoms:\n",
    "- you hide buttons for unauthorized users but don\u2019t enforce in backend\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "- authorization bypass vulnerabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anti-pattern D: Query logic scattered everywhere\n",
    "Symptoms:\n",
    "- `.filter(...)` repeated in many views\n",
    "- inconsistent `.select_related`/`.prefetch_related`\n",
    "- N+1 regressions\n",

    "## 22.3 The Practical Layered Pattern (Django-Friendly)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple, effective architecture used by many professional Django teams:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Views:\n",
    "   - HTTP method handling\n",
    "   - choose template/response\n",
    "   - call services/selectors\n",
    "2. Forms:\n",
    "   - validate inputs (and normalize types)\n",
    "3. Selectors (Read layer):\n",
    "   - QuerySets and read-only query helpers\n",
    "   - enforce scoping and prefetching patterns\n",
    "4. Services (Write layer):\n",
    "   - create/update workflows\n",
    "   - transaction boundaries\n",
    "   - domain events (email, logging, etc.)\n",
    "5. Permissions/Policies:\n",
    "   - \u201ccan user do X to object Y?\u201d\n",
    "   - centralized authorization logic\n",
    "6. Models:\n",
    "   - schema + minimal domain behavior tightly tied to the model itself\n",
    "   - avoid external side effects in model methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not \u201chexagonal architecture\u201d with heavy abstractions. It\u2019s lightweight and\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 22.4 Standard Module Layout Inside an App\n",
