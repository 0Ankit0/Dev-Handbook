    "\n",
    "This chapter is \u201cAPI design literacy.\u201d Before using Django REST Framework (DRF),\n",
    "you must understand what a good API *is* and why it\u2019s structured the way it is.\n",

    "A strong API foundation prevents:\n",
    "- inconsistent endpoints across your team\n",
    "- confusing error formats\n",

    "By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain what an API is and how it differs from server-rendered HTML.\n",
    "2. Design resource-oriented URLs and choose correct HTTP methods.\n",
    "3. Use correct status codes and response bodies for success and errors.\n",
    "4. Design consistent JSON shapes and naming conventions.\n",
    "5. Implement pagination, filtering, sorting, and searching via query params (and\n",
    "   explain the tradeoffs).\n",
    "6. Understand API authentication options (session vs token vs JWT) and the CSRF/CORS\n",
    "   implications.\n",
    "7. Choose an API versioning strategy and apply it.\n",
    "8. Write a basic JSON endpoint in Django (without DRF) to practice the concepts.\n",

    "## 23.1 What an API Is (and Why You Need One)\n",
    "\n",
    "An **API (Application Programming Interface)** in web context is a set of HTTP\n",
    "endpoints designed primarily for **machines** (frontends, mobile apps, other\n",
    "services) rather than human browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23.1.1 HTML pages vs JSON APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Server-rendered HTML endpoint\n",
    "- Client: browser\n",
    "- Response: HTML\n",
    "- Goal: display UI\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- `GET /articles/hello-django/` \u2192 HTML page\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JSON API endpoint\n",
    "- Client: frontend JS, mobile app, another server, CLI script\n",
    "- Response: JSON\n",
    "- Goal: exchange structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- `GET /api/articles/42/` \u2192 JSON `{id, title, ...}`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23.1.2 One product can (and often should) have both\n",
    "Common real-world architectures:\n",
    "- Django templates for admin/internal pages\n",
    "- JSON APIs for mobile apps and SPAs\n",
    "- Webhooks endpoints for third-party integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23.2 REST (Practical, Not Religious)\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is a style for designing APIs around **resources** and using HTTP methods\n",
    "consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23.2.1 Core REST concepts (what matters)\n",
    "- **Resource**: a thing you manage (article, task, comment, user).\n",
    "- **Collection**: group of resources (`/api/articles/`).\n",
    "- **Representation**: how a resource is serialized (JSON).\n",
    "- **Uniform interface**: consistent use of methods + status codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23.2.2 Resource-oriented URL design\n",
    "\n",
    "Good patterns (nouns, collections):\n",
    "- `/api/articles/` (collection)\n",
    "- `/api/articles/42/` (single resource)\n",
    "- `/api/tasks/` and `/api/tasks/123/`\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid \u201cRPC-like\u201d endpoints unless necessary:\n",
    "- `/api/doPublishArticle/` (harder to standardize and document)\n",

    "Sometimes action endpoints are fine if they represent a subresource or state change:\n",
    "- `/api/articles/42/publish/` (action)\n",
    "But you should treat it as a deliberate choice, not default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23.2.3 Plural vs singular\n",
    "Industry convention:\n",
    "- collections are plural: `/api/articles/`\n",
    "- single resource: `/api/articles/{id}/`\n",

    "### 23.3.1 Safe vs idempotent (critical for APIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safe**: should not change server state (GET, HEAD).\n",
    "- **Idempotent**: doing it multiple times has the same effect as once (PUT, DELETE\n",
    "  typically; GET too).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why you care:\n",
    "- clients retry requests\n",
    "- proxies may retry\n",
    "- mobile networks are unreliable\n",
    "- idempotency prevents duplicate creates/charges\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23.3.2 CRUD mapping (typical)\n",
    "- `GET /api/articles/` \u2192 list\n",
    "- `POST /api/articles/` \u2192 create\n",
    "- `GET /api/articles/{id}/` \u2192 retrieve\n",

    "  - client sends partial object\n",

    "Industry reality:\n",
    "- most clients prefer PATCH for updates because they often only change a few fields\n",

    "## 23.4 Status Codes (API Meaning + Example Payloads)\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 200 OK\n",
    "Success with response body:\n",
    "- GET returns data\n",

    "- missing required fields\n",
    "- invalid types\n",
    "- invalid query params\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 401 Unauthorized\n",
    "Not authenticated:\n",
    "- missing/invalid auth credentials\n",

    "#### 403 Forbidden\n",
    "Authenticated but not allowed:\n",
    "- permission denied\n",
    "- object-level restriction\n",

    "#### 404 Not Found\n",
    "Resource doesn\u2019t exist OR you choose to hide it for authorization reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 409 Conflict\n",
    "Conflicts with current state:\n",
    "- duplicate unique fields\n",
    "- state transition invalid (e.g., \u201calready published\u201d)\n",
    "Not mandatory, but useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 422 Unprocessable Entity (sometimes used)\n",
    "Some APIs use 422 for validation errors. Django/DRF typically uses 400 for validation\n",
    "errors. Choose one approach and be consistent.\n",

    "## 23.5 JSON Shapes: Consistency Rules That Make APIs Pleasant\n",
    "\n",
    "A \u201cgood\u201d API is consistent even when many developers contribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23.5.1 Naming conventions: snake_case vs camelCase\n",
    "Django + Python code typically uses `snake_case`. Many JS APIs use `camelCase`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Industry approach options:\n",
    "- Use `snake_case` in JSON (common with DRF; simplest for backend teams)\n",
    "- Use `camelCase` in JSON (common with JS-heavy teams; requires conversion layer)\n",

    "Choose one early and document it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workbook, we\u2019ll use `snake_case`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23.5.2 Envelope vs \u201cbare object\u201d\n",
    "Two patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bare object**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{ \"id\": 42, \"title\": \"Hello\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Envelope**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{ \"data\": { \"id\": 42, \"title\": \"Hello\" } }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For list responses, it\u2019s common to use an envelope:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"count\": 123,\n",
    "  \"next\": \"/api/articles/?page=2\",\n",
    "  \"previous\": null,\n",
    "  \"results\": [ ... ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is common because it supports pagination metadata cleanly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23.5.3 Error format (do not improvise per endpoint)\n",
    "\n",
    "A consistent error format is one of the most important \u201cindustry standard\u201d traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"error\": {\n",
    "    \"code\": \"validation_error\",\n",
    "    \"message\": \"Your request is invalid.\",\n",
    "    \"details\": {\n",
    "      \"title\": [\"This field is required.\"],\n",
    "      \"page\": [\"Must be >= 1.\"]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or a DRF-like default:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"title\": [\"This field is required.\"],\n",
    "  \"page\": [\"A valid integer is required.\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick a shape and keep it consistent. DRF provides a default error structure; many\n",
    "teams keep it rather than inventing a new one.\n",

    "---\n",

    "## 23.6 Content Negotiation: `Accept` and `Content-Type`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23.6.1 `Content-Type` (what you sent)\n",
    "When a client sends JSON:\n",
    "\n",
    "```http\n",

    "```\n",

    "- UX (app can load incrementally)\n",
    "\n",
