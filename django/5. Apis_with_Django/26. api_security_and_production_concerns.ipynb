    "1. Choose an API auth strategy and explain why:\n",
    "   - session cookies\n",
    "   - DRF token auth\n",
    "   - JWT (access + refresh)\n",
    "2. Configure CSRF correctly for cookie-based API clients (and know when CSRF is not\n",
    "   relevant).\n",
    "3. Configure CORS safely for cross-origin frontends.\n",
    "4. Apply “abuse prevention” controls:\n",
    "   - throttling\n",
    "   - pagination caps\n",
    "   - request body limits\n",
    "   - upload limits\n",
    "5. Prevent data leaks via:\n",
    "   - strict queryset scoping\n",
    "   - object-level permissions\n",
    "   - serializer write-field whitelisting\n",
    "6. Add OpenAPI docs and enforce “API contract” discipline.\n",
    "7. Implement a basic key rotation strategy for tokens/JWT.\n",
    "8. Add tests for:\n",

    "- **Broken access control** (most common, highest impact):\n",
    "  - user reads another user’s org data (tenant leak)\n",

    "- **Auth attacks**:\n",
    "  - credential stuffing on token endpoint\n",
    "  - stolen tokens used from other devices\n",
    "- **Abuse / DoS**:\n",
    "  - huge `page_size`, expensive filters, repeated requests\n",
    "  - large file uploads\n",
    "- **Injection**:\n",
    "  - usually mitigated by ORM, but can appear in raw SQL, sorting, filtering if unsafe\n",
    "- **Data exposure**:\n",
    "  - returning sensitive fields (emails, internal IDs) unintentionally\n",
    "- **Misconfiguration**:\n",
    "  - open CORS, debug mode, allowed hosts, insecure cookies, missing HTTPS\n",

    "## 26.2 Authentication Choices (Session vs Token vs JWT) — Deep, Practical\n",
    "\n",
    "Your auth choice controls:\n",
    "- whether CSRF matters\n",
    "- whether CORS matters\n",
    "- how clients store credentials\n",
    "- how you revoke access\n",
    "- operational complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.2.1 Option A — SessionAuthentication (cookie-based)\n",
    "**Best for:**\n",
    "- same-origin web apps\n",
    "- browsable API for developers\n",
    "- classic Django sites that add JSON endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- browser stores `sessionid` cookie\n",
    "- client sends cookie automatically\n",
    "- server uses session to authenticate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security implications:**\n",
    "- **CSRF is required** for unsafe methods because cookies are sent automatically.\n",
    "- Token theft via XSS is reduced if session cookie is HttpOnly, but XSS can still\n",
    "  perform actions as user (because it runs in user’s origin).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational:**\n",
    "- session storage backend must be reliable (DB/Redis)\n",
    "- easy logout (flush session)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.2.2 Option B — DRF TokenAuthentication (static token)\n",
    "**Best for:**\n",
    "- simple API clients (scripts, integrations)\n",
    "- internal services\n",
    "- mobile apps (sometimes) if rotation is handled manually\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- client stores a token string\n",
    "- client sends:\n",
    "  - `Authorization: Token <token>`\n",
    "- server validates token\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security implications:**\n",
    "- **CSRF is not required** (token not auto-sent by browser).\n",
    "- If token is stolen, attacker can use it until revoked.\n",
    "- Requires careful client storage (don’t put in localStorage if your web app is\n",
    "  vulnerable to XSS; in web apps prefer HttpOnly cookies or short-lived tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational:**\n",
    "- easy to implement\n",
    "- token revocation = delete token row\n",
    "- no built-in refresh/rotation by default\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.2.3 Option C — JWT (access + refresh tokens)\n",
    "**Best for:**\n",
    "- SPAs/mobile apps\n",
    "- multi-service architectures\n",
    "- when you need short-lived access tokens + refresh flows\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- client sends:\n",
    "  - `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`\n",
    "- access token is short-lived\n",
    "- refresh token obtains new access token\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security implications:**\n",
    "- CSRF not required if tokens are in Authorization header (not cookies).\n",
    "- Revocation and rotation require more design.\n",
    "- If you store refresh tokens insecurely, compromise is severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational:**\n",
    "- extra endpoints (token obtain/refresh/verify/revoke)\n",
    "- key management (signing keys)\n",
    "- potentially blacklists/rotation policies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.2.4 “Industry default” decision guidance\n",
    "- If your API is primarily consumed by **your own browser pages on the same domain**:\n",
    "  - SessionAuthentication is fine and simplest.\n",
    "- If your API is consumed by **mobile apps or third-party clients**:\n",
    "  - Token or JWT is more appropriate.\n",
    "- If your frontend is a **separate domain SPA**:\n",
    "  - JWT (or cookie-based session with strict CSRF + CORS) is common; choose\n",
    "    deliberately.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 26.3 CSRF in APIs (When It Matters and When It Doesn’t)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.3.1 CSRF matters when:\n",
    "- authentication relies on cookies (session, or cookie-stored tokens)\n",
    "- browser automatically includes credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.3.2 CSRF does not apply the same way when:\n",
    "- client sends `Authorization: Bearer ...` manually\n",
    "- a malicious site cannot force the browser to include that header automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.3.3 The common mistake\n",
    "People enable cookie-based auth for APIs and disable CSRF checks to “make it work.”\n",
    "That is a real vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct choices are:\n",
    "- keep cookie auth + CSRF properly configured, OR\n",
    "- move to token/JWT auth for cross-origin API clients\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 26.4 CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) — Correct Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "CORS is a **browser** security mechanism. It controls whether JavaScript running on\n",
    "one origin can read responses from another origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.4.1 When you need CORS\n",
    "You need CORS when:\n",
    "- your frontend runs on a different origin than the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- frontend: `https://app.example.com`\n",
    "- API: `https://api.example.com`\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser will block JS from reading API responses unless API returns correct CORS headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.4.2 CORS does *not* protect you from CSRF\n",
    "CORS controls reading responses.\n",
    "CSRF is about sending requests that change state with cookies attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can be vulnerable to CSRF even if CORS is “tight.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.4.3 Use `django-cors-headers` (common industry tool)\n",
    "Install (add to runtime dependencies):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m pip install django-cors-headers\n",
    "python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "INSTALLED_APPS += [\"corsheaders\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add middleware **near the top** (must run before CommonMiddleware in typical setups):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MIDDLEWARE = [\n",
    "    \"corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware\",\n",
    "    \"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "] + MIDDLEWARE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.4.4 Safe baseline CORS config (token/JWT auth, no cookies)\n",
    "In settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [\n",
    "    \"https://app.example.com\",\n",
    "]\n",
    "CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- JS from `app.example.com` can read responses\n",
    "- cookies are not included by browsers automatically (good if you don’t use cookie auth)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.4.5 Cookie-based auth + CORS (harder; do intentionally)\n",
    "If you choose cookie-based auth for a cross-origin SPA, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [\n",
    "    \"https://app.example.com\",\n",

    "    \"https://app.example.com\",\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "fetch(\"https://api.example.com/api/v1/...\", {\n",
    "  credentials: \"include\",\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security notes:**\n",
    "- Never set `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=True` with `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=True`.\n",
    "  That combination is extremely dangerous.\n",
    "- When using cookie auth cross-origin, CSRF must be handled carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.4.6 Preflight (OPTIONS) — what it is and why it matters\n",
    "For certain requests (e.g., non-simple methods/headers), browsers send an OPTIONS request first:\n",
    "\n",
    "- method: OPTIONS\n",
    "- asks: “Is it allowed to send POST with Authorization header?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Your server must respond with the correct CORS headers. `django-cors-headers` handles this.\n",

    "\n",
    "APIs must be resilient against “valid-looking” but abusive traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.5.1 Pagination caps (mandatory)\n",
    "In DRF, ensure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `page_size_query_param` exists only if you cap it (`max_page_size`)\n",
    "- otherwise attacker can request huge pages and overload DB and memory\n",

    "DRF throttling is good for:\n",
    "- baseline abuse prevention\n",

    "   - write a test that POST without token returns 401\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add throttling to the token endpoint:\n",
    "   - configure `anon: 5/min` for `/api/v1/auth/token/`\n",
    "   - write a test that eventually returns 429\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Configure CORS for a fake SPA origin:\n",
    "   - allow `https://app.example.com`\n",
    "   - write a test verifying CORS header is present for allowed origin\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add an explicit page size cap test:\n",
    "   - request `page_size=999999`\n",
    "   - assert response uses capped value (or returns 400, depending on your policy)\n",
