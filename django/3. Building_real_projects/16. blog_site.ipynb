    "- documentation/news site\n",
    "- internal knowledge base\n",
    "- editorial publishing tool\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build (with explanations + code):\n",
    "- public article listing (search + tag filter + pagination)\n",
    "- public article detail page with cover image + SEO meta\n",
    "- draft visibility rules (public sees only published; authors/staff can preview)\n",

    "## 16.1 Requirements and User Stories (Write These Down)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public site\n",
    "1. As a visitor, I can see a list of published articles ordered by newest.\n",
    "2. As a visitor, I can search articles by title/body.\n",
    "3. As a visitor, I can filter articles by tag.\n",
    "4. As a visitor, I can paginate through articles.\n",
    "5. As a visitor, I can open an article and see its cover image, body, tags, and publish date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auth + editorial workflow\n",
    "6. As a logged-in user, I can create an article (default draft).\n",
    "7. As the author, I can edit my own article.\n",
    "8. As staff, I can edit any article.\n",
    "9. As a visitor, I cannot view drafts (should be 404 or 403 depending on policy).\n",
    "10. As an author/staff, I can preview drafts via the normal detail URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments (beginner-friendly moderation workflow)\n",
    "11. As a visitor, I can submit a comment to an article (requires name + body).\n",
    "12. As an admin/staff, I can approve comments before they appear publicly.\n",
    "13. As a visitor, I only see approved comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SEO basics\n",
    "14. As a search engine, I can discover site URLs via sitemap.\n",
    "15. Robots can access public pages; admin pages are disallowed in robots.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16.2 Route Map (Industry-Standard URL Design)\n",
    "\n",
    "We\u2019ll design a clean, stable URL structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Article list: `GET /articles/`\n",
    "- Article detail: `GET /articles/<slug>/`\n",
    "- Article create: `GET/POST /articles/new/`\n",
    "- Article edit: `GET/POST /articles/<slug>/edit/`\n",
    "- Comment create: `POST /articles/<slug>/comments/`\n",
    "- Sitemap: `GET /sitemap.xml`\n",
    "- Robots: `GET /robots.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this structure is standard\n",
    "- `/articles/` is the \u201ccollection\u201d\n",
    "- `/articles/<slug>/` is a \u201cresource\u201d\n",
    "- `new/` and `edit/` are explicit actions (kept more specific than `<slug>`)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16.3 Model Improvements: Add `get_absolute_url()` (SEO + Reuse)\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common Django convention is to define `get_absolute_url()` on models so\n",
    "templates and sitemap generation can rely on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit `articles/models.py` (inside `Article`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.urls import reverse\n",

    "class Article(models.Model):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    def get_absolute_url(self) -> str:\n",
    "        return reverse(\"articles:detail\", kwargs={\"slug\": self.slug})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "- Templates can use `{{ article.get_absolute_url }}` without knowing route names.\n",
    "- Sitemaps can use it automatically.\n",
    "- If you ever change URLs, you update one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we\u2019ll standardize route names to match that.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16.4 Refactor URLs to a Clean Public Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now your app likely has mixed `html/` paths. For a real content site, make\n",
    "HTML the default and (optionally) move JSON to `/api/` later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.4.1 Update `articles/urls.py`\n",
    "Replace with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.urls import path\n",

    "\n",

    "Edit `templates/partials/_nav.html` accordingly:\n",

    "- `Article.objects.published()` becomes a readable, consistent query.\n",

    "- [ ] Comment submission works and is moderated\n",
    "- [ ] Create/edit requires login and enforces ownership rules\n",

    "### Security\n",
    "- [ ] All POST forms include `{% csrf_token %}`\n",
    "- [ ] Drafts are not visible publicly\n",
    "- [ ] Upload size/type validation exists for cover images\n",

    "- [ ] No obvious N+1 in templates when iterating tags\n",

    "### Quality\n",
    "- [ ] `python manage.py test` passes\n",
    "- [ ] `ruff`/`black --check` pass\n",
    "- [ ] admin is usable (filters/search/actions)\n",
