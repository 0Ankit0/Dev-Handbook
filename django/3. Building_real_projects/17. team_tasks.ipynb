    "1. **Add membership management UI (non-admin)**\n",
    "   - Build `/orgs/<slug>/members/` list page\n",
    "   - Admin-only invite/add (you can do it via admin first)\n",
    "   - Explain why membership is org-scoped and must not be globally editable\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improve pagination querystring correctness**\n",
    "   - Create a template tag `querystring` that:\n",
    "     - starts from `request.GET`\n",
    "     - replaces `page`\n",
    "     - removes duplicate page keys\n",
    "   - Use it in `_pagination.html`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add \u201cMy tasks\u201d quick filter**\n",
    "   - On list page, add a link that sets `assigned_to=me`\n",
    "   - Ensure it composes with existing filters\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add index-driven ordering**\n",
    "   - Add a list mode `?sort=due_date`\n",
    "   - Ensure you order with nulls last (SQLite behavior differs; document limitations)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Add tests for event logging**\n",
    "   - Change status in POST edit\n",
    "   - Assert one `TaskEvent` row created with correct details\n",
