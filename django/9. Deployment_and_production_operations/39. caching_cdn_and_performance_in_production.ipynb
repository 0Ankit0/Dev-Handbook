    "   - CDN cache\n",
    "   - server-side cache (Redis)\n",
    "2. Configure Redis caching in Django correctly.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cache things that are:\n",
    "- expensive to compute\n",
    "- requested frequently\n",
    "- stable for some period\n",
    "- safe to serve cached to multiple users (public) OR varied appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "Common \u201chigh ROI\u201d caches:\n",
    "- article list pages (public)\n",
    "- top tags sidebar (public)\n",

    "- expensive DB aggregations (counts)\n",
    "- computed settings/config objects\n",

    "Avoid caching:\n",

    "---\n",

    "## 39.4 Per-View Caching in Production (Safe Use)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.4.1 Cache public pages only (default safe rule)\n",
    "Example: public article list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page\n",
    "from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "@cache_page(60)\n",
    "def article_list(request):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important: query string variation\n",
    "Django per-view cache keys include the full path including query string, so:\n",
    "- `/articles/?tag=django` caches separately from `/articles/?tag=cbv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.4.2 Vary headers when needed\n",
    "If a view response varies by header (e.g., language), use `vary_on_headers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.views.decorators.vary import vary_on_headers\n",

    "### 39.4.3 User-specific caching is dangerous if done wrong\n",
    "If you cache a view that includes `user.username` and don\u2019t vary by session/user,\n",
    "you can leak user info.\n",
    "\n",
    "Industry rule:\n",
    "- don\u2019t cache authenticated HTML pages globally unless you have deep understanding\n",

    "---\n",

    "## 39.5 Template Fragment Caching (Often the Best Balance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fragment caching avoids caching the whole page, but caches the expensive part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: top tags in article list template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```django\n",
    "{% load cache %}\n",
    "{% cache 300 \"top_tags_v1\" %}\n",
    "  ... expensive sidebar ...\n",
    "{% endcache %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.5.1 Cache key versioning\n",
    "Include a version string like `\"top_tags_v1\"`.\n",
    "When you change the template/logic, bump to `\"top_tags_v2\"` to avoid stale HTML\n",
    "format issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.5.2 Vary by language or tenant if needed\n",
    "If your site is multi-tenant or multilingual, add key parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```django\n",
    "{% cache 300 \"top_tags_v1\" organization.id %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## 39.6 Low-Level Caching (Keyed Values, Not HTML)\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-level caching is best for:\n",
    "- computed query results\n",
    "- API response objects (carefully)\n",
    "- permission checks caching (carefully)\n",
    "- expensive external calls (with TTL and fallback)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.6.1 Use stable key patterns\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.core.cache import cache\n",
    "\n",
    "def cache_key(*parts: str) -> str:\n",
    "    return \"myapp:\" + \":\".join(parts)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "key = cache_key(\"org\", str(org.id), \"task_counts\", \"v1\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.6.2 Cache invalidation patterns (practical)\n",
    "- TTL-based: simplest and robust for most UI caches\n",
    "- Version bump: manual invalidation by key version\n",
    "- Event-based: delete keys when data changes (signals/services)\n",
    "  - more complex, can be brittle if you forget to invalidate somewhere\n",
    "\n",
    "Industry advice:\n",
    "- Start with TTL + versioning.\n",
    "- Add event-based invalidation only for very sensitive correctness needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 39.7 HTTP Cache Headers (Browser and CDN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even without server-side caching, correct HTTP headers reduce load.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.7.1 Cache-Control basics\n",
    "- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=...` for public resources\n",
    "- `Cache-Control: private` for user-specific\n",
    "- `Cache-Control: no-store` for extremely sensitive (e.g., bank statements)\n",
    "- `Cache-Control: no-cache` means \u201cstore but revalidate\u201d\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.7.2 Example: sitemap.xml caching\n",
    "Sitemap changes rarely. Cache it for 1 hour:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page\n",
    "from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you have a sitemap view, wrap with cache_page\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or set headers manually:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response[\"Cache-Control\"] = \"public, max-age=3600\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.7.3 ETags and conditional GET (304)\n",
    "If you support ETags:\n",
    "- client sends `If-None-Match: <etag>`\n",
    "- server can return `304 Not Modified` without body\n",
    "\n",
    "Django provides helpers like `@condition` / `@etag` (from `django.views.decorators.http`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.views.decorators.http import etag\n",
    "\n",
    "def articles_etag(request):\n",
    "    # compute a simple etag based on latest updated article timestamp\n",
    "    latest = Article.objects.published().order_by(\"-updated_at\").values_list(\"updated_at\", flat=True).first()\n",
    "    return str(latest.timestamp()) if latest else \"empty\"\n",
    "\n",
    "@etag(articles_etag)\n",
    "def article_list(request):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If unchanged, Django returns 304 automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry note:** ETags are powerful but require careful design to avoid heavy DB\n",
    "work on every request. Often you:\n",
    "- store a \u201ccontent version\u201d in cache\n",
    "- or compute ETag cheaply from a known \u201clast updated\u201d value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 39.8 CDN for Static Assets (Industry Standard)\n",
    "\n",
    "Static assets should be cached aggressively:\n",
    "- hashed filenames (e.g., `site.9a8f3.css`)\n",
    "- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`\n",
    "\n",
    "Django supports hashed static files using:\n",
    "- `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` (built-in)\n",
    "- or WhiteNoise storage backends\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.8.1 Enable manifest storage (common)\n",
    "In production settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "STORAGES = {\n",
    "    \"staticfiles\": {\n",
    "        \"BACKEND\": \"django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.ManifestStaticFilesStorage\",\n",

    "Your templates using `{% static 'css/site.css' %}` will automatically resolve to the\n",
    "hashed name, enabling long caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.8.2 Use CDN URL prefix for static\n",
    "If you use a CDN:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "STATIC_URL = \"https://cdn.example.com/static/\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `{% static %}` outputs CDN URLs.\n",

    "\n",
    "The most dangerous caching bug:\n",
    "- caching a response that contains user-specific data\n",
    "- serving it to someone else\n",
    "\n",

    "- Ensure `Cache-Control: private` on authenticated HTML responses.\n",
    "- Avoid caching responses that include CSRF tokens in shared caches/CDN without\n",
    "  proper variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 39.9.2 Varying by Cookie is usually a bad idea\n",
    "If you add `Vary: Cookie`, shared caches/CDNs will treat every user as separate,\n",
    "which destroys caching benefit. Better:\n",
    "- don\u2019t cache those pages\n",

    "\n",
    "A simple strategy that works for many apps:\n",
