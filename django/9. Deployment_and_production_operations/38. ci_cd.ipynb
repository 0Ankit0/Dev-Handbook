    "- **CI (Continuous Integration)** automatically checks every change:\n",
    "  - lint/format\n",
    "  - tests\n",
    "  - migrations\n",

    "- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)** automates releases:\n",
    "  - build artifact/container\n",

    "By the end, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a CI pipeline that:\n",
    "   - installs dependencies\n",
    "   - runs Ruff, Black (check mode), tests, coverage\n",
    "   - runs `makemigrations --check --dry-run`\n",
    "   - runs `migrate` on a fresh DB\n",
    "2. Run CI against PostgreSQL (not SQLite) to match production.\n",
    "3. Add a minimal security scanning step (dependency audit) without noise.\n",
    "4. Build and publish a Docker image (optional but industry common).\n",
    "5. Design a CD workflow:\n",
    "   - staged deploys (staging → production)\n",
    "   - migrations and collectstatic steps\n",
    "   - smoke checks (`/readyz`)\n",
    "6. Understand secrets management in CI.\n",
    "7. Prevent “works locally but fails in CI” issues with a consistent workflow.\n",

    "## 38.1 What CI/CD Should Enforce (Professional Gatekeeping)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.1.1 Minimum CI checks (baseline)\n",
    "- Lint: `ruff check .`\n",
    "- Format: `black --check .`\n",
    "- Tests: `pytest` or `python manage.py test`\n",
    "- Migrations:\n",
    "  - `makemigrations --check --dry-run`\n",
    "  - `migrate` to ensure migration graph applies\n",
    "- Optional but recommended:\n",
    "  - coverage threshold\n",
    "  - query-count regression tests\n",
    "  - static type checks (mypy/pyright) later\n",
    "  - security checks (pip-audit) later\n",
    "\n",
    "### 38.1.2 Why CI must run migrations\n",
    "Because one of the most common production failure modes is:\n",
    "- code deployed but schema mismatched\n",
    "- migrations missing or broken\n",
    "- migration file not committed\n",
    "\n",
    "CI must catch that.\n",

    "- Run migrations as part of deploy (release step)\n",
    "- Run migrations as a separate job that runs before web restarts\n",
