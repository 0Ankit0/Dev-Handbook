    "5. Add a simple page endpoint and a JSON health endpoint.\n",
    "6. Add basic tests for those endpoints.\n",
    "7. Understand the minimum settings that matter at the start:\n",
    "   - `INSTALLED_APPS`, `MIDDLEWARE`, `TEMPLATES`, `DATABASES`, `STATIC_URL`,\n",
    "     `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `DEBUG`, `SECRET_KEY`\n",

    "- minimal \u201crandom upgrade broke everything\u201d surprises\n",
    "- clean separation of runtime vs dev dependencies\n",

    "### 4.1.2 Decide where dependencies live\n",
    "A common practical split:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `requirements.txt` \u2192 runtime dependencies (Django + packages used by the app)\n",

    "### 4.10.1 `DEBUG`\n",
    "- `DEBUG=True` gives helpful error pages and auto-reload.\n",
