    "## 5. Django Architecture Overview (How Django Really Works End-to-End)\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is the “wiring diagram” of Django. You’ll learn what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "- when Django starts,\n",
    "- when a request comes in,\n",
    "- how URLs find views,\n",
    "- how middleware wraps the request/response,\n",
    "- how templates are located and rendered,\n",
    "- where settings affect behavior,\n",
    "- how WSGI/ASGI fit into deployment,\n",
    "- and how static/media differ (and why it matters in production).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand this chapter deeply, you’ll stop “copy-pasting Django patterns”\n",
    "and start *designing* Django systems.\n",

    "## 5.0 Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain Django’s core components: project, apps, settings, URLconf, views,\n",
    "   templates, models, middleware.\n",
    "2. Trace a request from the web server to Django and back (including middleware).\n",
    "3. Explain MTV (Model–Template–View) and how it maps to MVC.\n",
    "4. Explain what `manage.py` does and why it’s used.\n",
    "5. Explain WSGI vs ASGI (what they are, when you choose which).\n",
    "6. Explain static vs media files and how they’re served in dev vs production.\n",
    "7. Set up a simple custom middleware and prove it runs.\n",
    "8. Understand environments (dev/staging/prod) and why settings must be managed via\n",

    "## 5.1 Django’s Big Picture: “A Configured Request/Response Engine”\n",
    "\n",
    "Django is essentially:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a startup phase where it loads configuration and builds an application object\n",
    "- a request phase where it:\n",
    "  - runs middleware\n",
    "  - resolves URL → view\n",
    "  - returns response\n",
    "- a response phase where it:\n",
    "  - runs middleware (reverse order)\n",
    "  - returns response to server\n",

    "### 5.1.1 The core loop in Django terms\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "HTTP Request\n",
    "  -> Django middleware (in order)\n",
    "  -> URL resolver\n",
    "  -> View (your code)\n",
    "  -> Template rendering / ORM / business logic (your code + Django)\n",
    "  -> HttpResponse / JsonResponse / RedirectResponse\n",
    "  -> Django middleware (reverse order)\n",
    "HTTP Response\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 5.2 MTV Explained (and Why It’s Not Actually Confusing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Django uses the term **MTV**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model**: data + database mapping (ORM)\n",
    "- **Template**: presentation (HTML templates)\n",
    "- **View**: the request handler (the function/class you write)\n",
    "\n",
    "People coming from “MVC” sometimes get confused because in many MVC frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Controller** handles request logic\n",
    "- **View** is the HTML template\n",
    "\n",
    "Django’s naming is basically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Django **View** ≈ MVC **Controller**\n",
    "- Django **Template** ≈ MVC **View**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2.1 A minimal MTV example (with clear mapping)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model** (later chapters, preview only):\n",

    "## 5.3 Startup: What Happens When Django Boots\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py runserver\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Django must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Locate your settings module\n",
    "2. Load settings\n",
    "3. Build an app registry from `INSTALLED_APPS`\n",
    "4. Import app modules as needed (models, admin, etc.)\n",
    "5. Prepare URL configuration (not always fully resolved immediately, but available)\n",
    "6. Start serving requests (runserver) or run commands (migrate/test/etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3.1 The role of `manage.py` (why it exists)\n",
    "\n",
    "Open your `manage.py`. It typically does two key things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sets the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`\n",
    "- calls Django’s command runner\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s what makes this work:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py migrate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `manage.py`, Django wouldn’t know which settings to use unless you set\n",
    "environment variables manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3.2 What is `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`?\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a pointer to the Python module path for settings, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "config.settings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning:\n",
    "- import `config/settings.py` as your settings source\n",
    "\n",
    "You can prove it exists at runtime:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# anywhere in Django runtime, e.g., a view\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "value = os.environ.get(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, your process manager sets it, or your WSGI/ASGI entry point sets it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.4 Settings: The Central Control Panel\n",
    "\n",
    "Settings are not “just config.” They affect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- security behavior (CSRF, cookies, allowed hosts)\n",
    "- what apps exist\n",
    "- middleware pipeline\n",
    "- database connections\n",
    "- templates\n",
    "- static/media file behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4.1 Settings are Python code (powerful and dangerous)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `settings.py` is Python, you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "DEBUG = os.environ.get(\"DEBUG\", \"false\").lower() == \"true\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is flexible, but it also means:\n",
    "- don’t put heavy logic in settings\n",
    "- don’t do network calls at import time\n",
    "- keep settings predictable and environment-driven\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4.2 The settings you must understand early\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `INSTALLED_APPS`\n",
    "List of apps Django loads. It controls:\n",
    "- app registry\n",
    "- model discovery/migrations\n",
    "- template discovery (when `APP_DIRS=True`)\n",
    "- static file discovery (via `django.contrib.staticfiles`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (yours + Django defaults):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "INSTALLED_APPS = [\n",

    "Middleware wraps every request/response. Order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "Important keys:\n",
    "- `DIRS`: explicit template directories\n",
    "- `APP_DIRS`: whether Django auto-searches templates inside installed apps\n",
    "- `context_processors`: injects common variables into templates\n",

    "#### `DATABASES`\n",
    "Defines database connection settings (SQLite dev default).\n",

    "When Django starts, it builds an internal registry of installed apps. This enables:\n",
    "- model loading\n",
    "- signal connections (later)\n",
    "- admin discovery (later)\n",
    "- checks framework\n",

    "It keeps code modular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project-level routing stays readable.\n",
    "- Each app owns its routes.\n",
    "- You can move an app’s URLs under a prefix later without rewriting everything.\n",

    "\n",
    "Middleware is one of Django’s most important “architecture” concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.8.1 What middleware is (concretely)\n",
    "Middleware is code that runs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- before the view (on request in)\n",
    "- after the view (on response out)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases:\n",
    "- sessions\n",
    "- authentication\n",
    "- CSRF protection\n",
    "- security headers\n",
    "- logging\n",
    "- performance measurement\n",
    "- request IDs\n",
    "- locale/timezone selection\n",
    "- tenant resolution (multi-tenancy later)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.8.2 Why order matters (real example)\n",
    "If SessionMiddleware doesn’t run before AuthenticationMiddleware:\n",
    "- authentication can’t load the user from the session\n",
    "- `request.user` may not behave correctly\n",

    "\n",
    "- WSGI: traditional, synchronous request/response (HTTP)\n",
    "- ASGI: supports async and additional protocols (WebSockets), plus HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "Django provides both entry points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `config/wsgi.py` for WSGI servers (e.g., Gunicorn in WSGI mode)\n",
    "- `config/asgi.py` for ASGI servers (e.g., Uvicorn, Daphne)\n",

    "- you want simplest stable deployment\n",

    "This topic becomes critical the moment you deploy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.12.1 Static files: “part of your code”\n",

    "- CSS\n",

    "- Django can serve static files for convenience\n",

    "### 5.13.1 The rule: same code, different config\n",
