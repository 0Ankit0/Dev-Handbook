    "## 3.2 Git Fundamentals (What You Actually Need Daily)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.1 Why Git is non-negotiable\n",
    "Git provides:\n",
    "- history (who changed what and why)\n",
    "- collaboration (multiple people in parallel)\n",
    "- safe experimentation (branches)\n",
    "- rollback (revert a bad change)\n",
    "- code review workflows (PRs/MRs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.2 The 3 “areas” of Git (this removes 80% of confusion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is easiest when you understand these areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Working directory**: your files on disk (edited or not)\n",
    "2. **Staging area (index)**: what will go into the next commit\n",
    "3. **Repository (commits)**: permanent snapshots with history\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "edit file -> stage -> commit -> push\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.3 Commands you will use constantly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialize a repo\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### See status\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage files\n",
    "Stage one file:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add README.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage everything changed:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add -A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commit\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m \"Add project README\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### View history\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.4 Branching: the simplest safe workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a branch:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout -b feature/user-auth\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Modern git also supports:)\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git switch -c feature/user-auth\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Switch back to main:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.5 Merge vs rebase (with practical team guidance)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merge\n",
    "A merge combines branches and preserves their history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pros: safest, preserves exact history, easiest for beginners\n",
    "- Cons: can create “merge commits” that clutter history\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rebase\n",
    "A rebase replays your commits on top of another base.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pros: linear history, nice readable logs\n",
    "- Cons: can be dangerous if you rebase commits that others already pulled\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry rule (safe practice):**\n",
    "- Rebase your *local feature branch* onto updated main to resolve conflicts early.\n",
    "- Avoid rebasing shared/public branches after pushing (unless your team explicitly\n",
    "  uses that workflow).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.6 Pull strategies (avoid accidental messy merges)\n",
    "\n",
    "To pull changes from origin:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But “how pull behaves” depends on configuration (merge vs rebase).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common, clean setup for many teams:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global pull.rebase true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes `git pull` do “fetch + rebase” by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re not comfortable yet, it’s okay to keep default merge pulls—just be\n",
    "consistent and understand what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.7 Commit messages: what “good” looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "Good commit messages answer:\n",
    "- **What changed?**\n",
    "- **Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad:\n",
    "- “fix”\n",
    "- “changes”\n",
    "- “update stuff”\n",
    "\n",
    "Good:\n",
    "- “Add linting and formatting via pre-commit”\n",
    "- “Validate page_size query param and cap at 100”\n",
    "- “Fix N+1 query in article list by adding prefetch_related”\n",
    "\n",
    "Many teams use **Conventional Commits** (optional but common):\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "feat: add pagination to article list\n",
    "fix: handle invalid page parameter\n",
    "chore: configure pre-commit hooks\n",
    "refactor: extract pricing logic into service module\n",
    "test: add tests for slugify\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 3.3 Repo Hygiene (Files That Make Teams Productive)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.1 `.gitignore` (stop committing junk)\n",

    "- environment files (`.env`)\n",
    "- local DB files (like `db.sqlite3` for dev, depending on team)\n",

    "A good README includes:\n",
    "- what the project is\n",
    "- how to set up dev\n",
    "- how to run tests\n",

    "### 3.3.3 `.editorconfig` (prevents whitespace wars)\n",
    "This helps unify indentation, line endings, trailing spaces across editors.\n",

    "\n",
    "[*.md]\n",
    "trim_trailing_whitespace = false\n",
    "```\n",

    "A formatter rewrites code to a consistent style.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: eliminate debates about spacing/line breaks\n",

    "- Benefit: code review focuses on logic, not style\n",

    "- wrong argument types\n",
    "- missing attributes\n",
    "- incorrect return types\n",

    "A widely accepted baseline today:\n",

    "- **Black**: formatting\n",
