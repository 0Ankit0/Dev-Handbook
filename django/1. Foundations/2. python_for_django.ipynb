    "\n",
    "This chapter is not \u201clearn all Python.\u201d It\u2019s the *exact Python you\u2019ll constantly use*\n",
    "when building Django apps: environments, imports, modules, data handling, functions,\n",
    "classes, exceptions, logging, files, and environment variables (settings/secrets).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you master this chapter, you\u2019ll write Django code faster, debug confidently, and\n",
    "avoid the most common beginner pain points (import errors, broken environments,\n",
    "mystery settings bugs, messy data transformations).\n",

    "## 2.0 Learning Outcomes (What you must be able to do)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create and manage a clean Python environment for a Django project.\n",
    "2. Explain the difference between:\n",
    "   - a module vs a package\n",
    "   - an import path vs a filesystem path\n",
    "   - global vs local imports (and why Django sometimes \u201ccan\u2019t find\u201d your code)\n",
    "3. Use Python data structures to represent request data, DB-like records, and\n",
    "   template contexts.\n",
    "4. Write functions that accept `*args` / `**kwargs`, and understand why Django uses\n",
    "   them so often.\n",
    "5. Understand classes well enough to read and extend Django\u2019s:\n",
    "   - class-based views\n",

    "   - middleware\n",
    "6. Handle exceptions correctly, including \u201cfail fast\u201d vs \u201crecover gracefully.\u201d\n",
    "7. Use logging properly (instead of `print`) in app code.\n",

    "## 2.1 Python Environments (venv) and Dependency Management\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.1 Why environments exist (the real reason)\n",
    "If you install packages globally, you quickly get:\n",
    "- version conflicts between projects\n",
    "- \u201cworks on my machine\u201d issues\n",
    "- difficulty reproducing setups for teammates/CI/production\n",
    "\n",
    "A **virtual environment** isolates dependencies per project, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Project A uses Django 5.x + requests 2.x\n",
    "Project B uses Django 4.x + requests 3.x\n",
    "They don\u2019t break each other because they use separate envs.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2 The minimum industry-standard setup\n",
    "A common baseline (simple and widely used):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a virtual environment in `.venv/`\n",
    "- Activate it\n",
    "- Install dependencies with `pip`\n",
    "- Track dependencies in `requirements.txt` (and optionally `requirements-dev.txt`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create and activate a venv\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- macOS/Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",

    "- Windows PowerShell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ".\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify you\u2019re in the venv:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -c \"import sys; print(sys.executable)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a path containing `.venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.3 Installing packages with pip\n",
    "Inside the activated venv:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "python -m pip install django\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use `python -m pip` instead of `pip`?\n",
    "- It ensures the `pip` you\u2019re calling belongs to the current `python` interpreter,\n",
    "  reducing \u201cinstalled to wrong Python\u201d problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.4 Capturing dependencies (`requirements.txt`)\n",
    "To record installed packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, to recreate:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What `requirements.txt` actually does\n",
    "It pins specific versions (or ranges, depending on how you generate it), making your\n",
    "project reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Django==5.0.6\n",
    "asgiref==3.8.1\n",
    "sqlparse==0.5.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.5 \u201cPinned vs flexible\u201d versions (important concept)\n",
    "- **Pinned** (`Django==5.0.6`): reproducible, stable builds; safer for teams/CI.\n",
    "- **Flexible** (`Django>=5.0,<6.0`): allows upgrades; can introduce changes\n",
    "  unexpectedly if not locked elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Industry practice:\n",
    "- Applications often pin exact versions for production reproducibility.\n",
    "- Libraries may use version ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ll later learn about lockfiles and dependency update workflows; for now, aim for:\n",

    "## 2.2 Python Packages, Modules, and Imports (Why Django Import Errors Happen)\n",
    "\n",
    "Django projects are Python projects. Most \u201cDjango can\u2019t find X\u201d errors are actually\n",
    "Python import/package issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1 Module vs package (precise definitions)\n",
    "- **Module**: a single `.py` file you can import.\n",
    "  - Example: `utils.py` \u2192 `import utils`\n",
    "- **Package**: a directory of modules (usually with `__init__.py`).\n",
    "  - Example: `myapp/` containing `__init__.py`, `views.py`, `models.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "project_root/\n",
    "  myapp/\n",
    "    __init__.py\n",
    "    views.py\n",
    "    utils.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from myapp import utils\n",
    "from myapp.utils import some_function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2 How Python decides what you can import (sys.path)\n",
    "Python searches for imports in locations listed in `sys.path`. Typical entries:\n",
    "- the current working directory (or project root when running Django)\n",
    "- installed packages in the virtual environment\n",
    "- standard library\n",
    "\n",
    "You can inspect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "print(sys.path)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why:\n",
    "- running scripts from random directories can break imports\n",
    "- Django\u2019s `manage.py` helps by running with the project context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.3 Absolute imports vs relative imports\n",
    "**Absolute import** (most common in Django apps):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from myapp.services.billing import charge_customer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relative import** (can be useful inside a package):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from .billing import charge_customer\n",
    "from ..utils import money_to_cents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Industry practice in Django apps:\n",
    "- prefer absolute imports for clarity (especially across apps)\n",
    "- use relative imports inside tightly-coupled subpackages if you want\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.4 Common import mistake: naming collisions\n",
    "If you name your file `django.py`, you can break imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "django.py  (your file)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `import django` imports your file, not the real Django package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common \u201cdon\u2019t name your file this\u201d list:\n",
    "- `django.py`\n",
    "- `requests.py`\n",
    "- `json.py`\n",
    "- `logging.py`\n",
    "- `email.py`\n",

    "## 2.3 Data Structures You\u2019ll Use Constantly in Django\n",
    "\n",
    "Django code is mostly:\n",
    "- mapping keys to values (dict-like)\n",
    "- iterating lists of objects\n",
    "- representing structured data in nested shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.1 Lists (ordered collections)\n",
    "Use lists for:\n",
    "- ordered results\n",
    "- sequences of items\n",
    "- query results after evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "articles = [\"Intro\", \"Models\", \"Templates\"]\n",
    "articles.append(\"Forms\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Django, you might build a template context:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "context = {\n",
    "    \"featured_articles\": [\"Intro\", \"Models\", \"Templates\"],\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.2 Dicts (key/value mappings)\n",
    "Use dicts for:\n",
    "- structured records\n",
    "- configurations\n",
    "- template contexts\n",
    "- JSON responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Example record:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user = {\"id\": 9, \"username\": \"alice\", \"is_staff\": False}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Access:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "username = user[\"username\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Safer access with `.get` (avoids KeyError):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "timezone = user.get(\"timezone\", \"UTC\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Django, query params often behave dict-like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "/articles/?page=2&sort=price\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Django later exposes them as a mapping (a `QueryDict`), but the idea is the same:\n",
    "keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.3 Tuples (fixed-size records, immutable)\n",
    "Use tuples for:\n",
    "- coordinates, pairs\n",
    "- returning multiple values\n",
    "- constants\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MIN_MAX = (1, 100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.4 Sets (unique items)\n",
    "Use sets for:\n",
    "- uniqueness checks\n",
    "- membership tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "allowed_roles = {\"admin\", \"editor\", \"viewer\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "if role in allowed_roles:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.5 Comprehensions (industry standard for clean transformations)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List comprehension\n",
    "Transform a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names = [\" Alice \", \"Bob\", \"  Cara\"]\n",
    "clean = [n.strip() for n in names]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter + transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "evens_squared = [n * n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dict comprehension\n",
    "Build dicts cleanly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pairs = [(\"a\", 1), (\"b\", 2)]\n",
    "d = {k: v for k, v in pairs}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why this matters for Django\n",
    "You will constantly:\n",
    "- reshape data for templates\n",
    "- reshape data for APIs\n",
    "- build lookup maps (id \u2192 object)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (common optimization pattern):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "users = [\n",
    "    {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"A\"},\n",
    "    {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"B\"},\n",
    "]\n",
    "users_by_id = {u[\"id\"]: u for u in users}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lookup is fast:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "users_by_id[2]  # {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"B\"}\n",

    "## 2.4 Functions: Arguments, `*args`, `**kwargs`, and Why Django Uses Them\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.1 Functions are \u201ccallable units of behavior\u201d\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.2 Default parameters (common in configuration)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def format_price(amount, currency=\"USD\"):\n",
    "    return f\"{currency} {amount:.2f}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.3 `*args` and `**kwargs` (critical for Django)\n",
    "- `*args` collects extra positional arguments into a tuple.\n",
    "- `**kwargs` collects extra keyword arguments into a dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def demo(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "    return {\"args\": args, \"kwargs\": kwargs}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "result = demo(1, 2, x=10, y=20)\n",
    "# args -> (1, 2)\n",
    "# kwargs -> {\"x\": 10, \"y\": 20}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Django uses `**kwargs` in routing\n",
    "When Django matches a URL like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "/articles/42/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "it may pass captured path variables as keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def article_detail(request, article_id):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "article_detail(request, article_id=42)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So your view signature must accept those names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.4 Keyword-only arguments (useful for clarity)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def create_user(username, *, is_staff=False):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now `is_staff` must be passed by name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "create_user(\"alice\", is_staff=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents mistakes in function calls\u2014very useful in large codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.5 Pure functions vs side effects (quality concept)\n",
    "- Pure function: output depends only on input; no external changes.\n",
    "- Side effects: writes files, sends email, hits DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters in Django:\n",
    "- Pure functions are easy to test.\n",
    "- Side-effect functions should be separated/controlled (service layer, tasks, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example split:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_total(items):\n",
    "    return sum(item[\"price\"] for item in items)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def save_invoice_to_db(invoice):\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.5.1 Why this pattern exists\n",
    "Python files can be:\n",
    "- imported (as modules), or\n",
    "- executed (as scripts)\n",

    "\n",
    "When imported, `main()` won\u2019t run automatically. This prevents surprising side\n",
    "effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matters in Django because:\n",
    "- Django imports your modules on startup\n",
    "- you do not want \u201crandom code\u201d executing at import time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5.2 \u201cImport-time side effects\u201d are a common bug\n",
    "Bad pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# bad_module.py\n",
    "print(\"Running at import time!\")  # runs whenever imported\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If Django imports it, your print runs every startup (and can break things if it does\n",
    "real work like DB calls).\n",
    "\n",
    "Better pattern:\n",
    "- define functions/classes\n",
    "- run logic only in explicit entry points\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.6 Classes (Enough to Read and Extend Django)\n",
    "\n",
    "Django uses classes heavily (especially CBVs, forms, middleware).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6.1 What a class is (practically)\n",
    "A class bundles:\n",
    "- data (attributes)\n",
    "- behavior (methods)\n",

    "Why you care:\n",
    "- Django class-based views work like this: you override methods/attributes to change\n",
    "  behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6.3 Composition over inheritance (often better)\n",
    "Instead of subclassing everything, you can inject helpers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class EmailSender:\n",
    "    def send(self, to, subject, body):\n",
