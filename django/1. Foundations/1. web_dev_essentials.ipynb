    "\n",
    "At the most fundamental level, **web applications are request/response machines**.\n",

    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "https://example.com/articles/?page=2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "a typical sequence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DNS lookup**: Browser finds the IP address for `example.com`.\n",
    "2. **TCP connection** (or QUIC for HTTP/3): A network connection is established.\n",
    "3. **TLS handshake** (because it’s HTTPS): encryption keys are negotiated and the\n",
    "   server proves its identity with a certificate.\n",
    "4. **HTTP request is sent**: browser sends a request message containing method,\n",
    "   path, headers, and sometimes a body.\n",
    "5. **Reverse proxy/web server** (often Nginx/Caddy/load balancer) receives it:\n",
    "   - may serve static files directly (images, CSS)\n",
    "   - may forward dynamic requests to Django (Gunicorn/Uvicorn)\n",
    "6. **Django processes the request**:\n",
    "   - middleware runs (security, sessions, etc.)\n",
    "   - URL routing finds the right view\n",
    "   - view executes business logic (DB queries, validations)\n",
    "   - response object is created (HTML/JSON/redirect)\n",
    "7. **HTTP response is sent back**: includes status code, headers, and body.\n",
    "8. **Browser renders**:\n",
    "   - if HTML: parses it, fetches CSS/JS/images (each is more HTTP requests)\n",
    "   - if JSON: a JS app might render UI from it\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Why this matters for Django\n",
    "Django is built around this loop. Almost every Django concept maps to a part of it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **URLs**: deciding *which code* handles a request\n",
    "- **Views**: *the code* that builds a response\n",
    "- **Templates**: generating HTML\n",
    "- **Models/ORM**: reading/writing the database\n",

    "### 1.2.1 The structure of an HTTP request\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTTP request contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Request line**: method + path + protocol version\n",
    "2. **Headers**: key/value metadata\n",
    "3. **Blank line**\n",
    "4. **Body** (optional): data being sent to server\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (raw-ish):\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "POST /login/?next=/dashboard/ HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: example.com\n",
    "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 ...\n",

    "Content-Length: 33\n",
    "Cookie: csrftoken=abc; sessionid=xyz\n",
    "\n",
    "username=alice&password=secret\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s interpret it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `POST` means “I’m submitting data that changes server state” (often).\n",
    "- `/login/` is the **path** (which route should handle it).\n",
    "- `?next=/dashboard/` is the **query string**, usually optional behavior.\n",
    "- `Host` says which domain (important when many sites share one server).\n",
    "- `Accept` says what response formats the client can handle.\n",
    "- `Content-Type` says what format the request body is.\n",
    "- `Cookie` contains previously stored cookies (session state, CSRF token, etc).\n",
    "- Body contains form data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 The structure of an HTTP response\n",
    "\n",

    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `302 Found` = redirect (browser should go to another URL)\n",

    "## 1.3 HTTP Methods Deeply (Not Just “GET vs POST”)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.1 Safe vs idempotent (industry terms you must know)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safe method**: should not change server state.\n",
    "  - GET, HEAD are intended to be safe.\n",
    "- **Idempotent method**: repeating it produces the same result as doing it once.\n",
    "  - GET is idempotent.\n",
    "  - PUT is idempotent (replace resource with same representation repeatedly).\n",
    "  - DELETE is idempotent in the sense “after first delete, it remains deleted”.\n",
    "  - POST is generally **not** idempotent (two POSTs often create two records).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why you care:\n",
    "- browsers, proxies, CDNs, and prefetchers may retry or repeat requests.\n",
    "- caching mechanisms assume GET is safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.2 Practical meaning in Django apps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **GET** for:\n",
    "  - listing pages\n",
    "  - detail pages\n",
    "  - search pages\n",
    "  - pagination links\n",
    "- Use **POST** for:\n",
    "  - login\n",
    "  - signup\n",
    "  - create/update form submissions\n",
    "  - “actions” like “like”, “follow”, “pay”, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common industry guideline:\n",
    "- If clicking a link triggers a destructive action (delete), it’s a red flag because\n",
    "  links are GET requests. Destructive actions should require POST + CSRF protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Status Codes (What They Really Signal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Status codes are not just “numbers”; they inform browser behavior, caching, retries,\n",
    "and API clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4.1 The categories\n",
    "- 2xx: success\n",
    "- 3xx: redirect\n",
    "- 4xx: client made a bad request or lacks permissions\n",
    "- 5xx: server error\n",

    "### 1.4.2 Important codes with realistic Django implications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **200 OK**: normal response\n",
    "- **201 Created**: common for API creation\n",
    "- **204 No Content**: success with no body (common after delete)\n",
    "- **301/302**: redirect\n",
    "  - Django’s `redirect(...)` is typically 302.\n",
    "- **400 Bad Request**: invalid input (API), malformed request\n",
    "- **401 Unauthorized**: “you are not authenticated”\n",
    "- **403 Forbidden**:\n",
    "  - authenticated but not allowed\n",
    "  - CSRF failure is often surfaced as 403\n",
    "- **404 Not Found**: wrong URL or object missing (Django uses 404 often)\n",
    "- **405 Method Not Allowed**: route exists but method not allowed\n",
    "- **500**: unhandled error in your code\n",

    "\n",
    "This is where your pagination question fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5.1 URL anatomy (what gets sent to server)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "https://example.com:443/products/42/?page=2&sort=price#reviews\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `https` (scheme): determines protocol + security expectations.\n",
    "- `example.com` (host): domain.\n",
    "- `:443` (port): usually omitted; default HTTPS port is 443.\n",
    "- `/products/42/` (path): identifies the resource or page.\n",
    "- `?page=2&sort=price` (query string): optional parameters that modify behavior.\n",
    "- `#reviews` (fragment): **not sent to the server**. Used only by browser to jump\n",
    "  within a page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5.2 What does `?` mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "`?` marks the beginning of the **query string** section of a URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everything **before** `?` is the path.\n",
    "- Everything **after** `?` (until `#` if present) is query parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "/path/to/page?key=value&key2=value2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Query parameters are typically `name=value` pairs.\n",
    "- `&` separates multiple parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "?page=2&sort=price\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "means:\n",
    "- parameter `page` has value `2`\n",
    "- parameter `sort` has value `price`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5.3 Why query parameters exist (what they’re for)\n",
    "\n",
    "Query parameters are used for **optional, non-identifying inputs** that modify how a\n",
    "resource is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classic uses:\n",
    "- pagination (`?page=2`)\n",
    "- filtering (`?status=published`)\n",
    "- sorting (`?sort=price`)\n",
    "- searching (`?q=django`)\n",
    "- toggling expansions (`?include=comments`)\n",
    "- tracking/analytics (`?utm_source=...`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not always put these in the path?\n",
    "- The path typically identifies “what resource is this?”\n",
    "- The query string typically describes “how do you want it returned?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Example difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `/products/` → “the products collection”\n",
    "- `/products/?page=2` → “products collection, second page”\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation improves:\n",
    "- predictability\n",
    "- caching behavior\n",
    "- link sharing\n",
    "- standard tooling compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5.4 URL encoding (important when values contain spaces/symbols)\n",
    "\n",
    "Query strings use URL encoding. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- space may become `%20` (or `+` in form encoding contexts)\n",
    "- `&` and `=` have special meaning, so they must be encoded if part of a value\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "?q=django orm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is not safe as-is. It becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "?q=django%20orm\n",

    "## 1.6 Pagination: Why It Exists, Why `?page=2` is Common, and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6.1 What pagination is\n",
    "Pagination means returning a large list in smaller chunks (“pages”), such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Page 1: items 1–20\n",
    "- Page 2: items 21–40\n",
    "- Page 3: items 41–60\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6.2 Why pagination exists (real reasons in production)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without pagination:\n",
    "- The server might try to fetch and serialize/render thousands of items.\n",
    "- The database query may be slow.\n",
    "- The response could be huge (MBs), slow to download, slow to render.\n",
    "- The browser becomes sluggish.\n",
    "- Mobile devices/data plans suffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pagination is both a **performance feature** and a **user experience feature**:\n",
    "- users don’t want an endless wall of content\n",
    "- they want navigation and “where am I?” context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6.3 Why `?page=2` is structured like that (and why it’s the default pattern)\n",
    "\n",
    "`?page=2` is a query parameter because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pagination modifies how you view the same resource collection (`/articles/`).\n",
    "2. The underlying “resource” is still the articles collection; you’re not accessing a\n",
    "   different kind of resource, just a different slice.\n",
    "3. It’s easy to create links:\n",
    "   - `/articles/?page=1`\n",
    "   - `/articles/?page=2`\n",
    "4. It plays well with caching/CDNs and with bookmarking/shareable URLs.\n",
    "5. It composes cleanly with other query parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "/articles/?tag=django&sort=newest&page=3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This composability is a major industry reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6.4 How pagination works conceptually (offset pagination)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most classic pagination maps page number to an offset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- page size = 20\n",
    "- page 1 offset = 0\n",
    "- page 2 offset = 20\n",
    "- page 3 offset = 40\n",
    "\n",
    "General formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "- offset = (page - 1) * page_size\n",
    "\n",
    "So `?page=3` with size 20 means “skip 40, return next 20”.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is easy and user-friendly, but has limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6.5 Limitations of page-number pagination (important!)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation A: Data changes cause duplicates/missing items\n",
    "If new records are inserted while the user is paging:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User loads page 1 (items A–T)\n",
    "- New items are inserted at the top\n",
    "- User loads page 2; offset-based logic now shifts results\n",
    "- User may see duplicates or miss items\n",
    "\n",
    "This is common in feeds (news, social timelines).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation B: Large offsets can be slow in databases\n",
    "For many databases, `OFFSET 100000` can get expensive because the DB may have to\n",
    "scan/skip many rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can become a performance bottleneck at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation C: Page boundaries are arbitrary\n",
    "If sorting changes, page membership changes. This isn’t “wrong,” but it affects UX\n",
    "consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6.6 Alternatives: limit/offset vs cursor pagination\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1) Limit/offset pagination\n",
    "Common in APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "GET /api/articles?limit=20&offset=40\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- explicit and flexible\n",
    "- easy for infinite scroll (“load next 20”)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- same shifting/duplication problem if data changes\n",
    "- large offset performance issues still exist\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2) Cursor pagination (a more scalable approach)\n",
    "Often looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "GET /api/articles?cursor=eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ==&page_size=20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "GET /api/articles?after=2026-02-01T10:00:00Z&limit=20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of “page 2”, you say “give me items after this cursor”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- stable pagination even as new items appear (if designed correctly)\n",
    "- better performance at scale (no huge OFFSET)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- harder to implement and debug\n",
    "- can be less user-friendly for “jump to page 50”\n",
    "- cursors can be opaque and require consistent ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6.7 What is `page_size` and why might you expose it?\n",
    "`page_size` is “how many items per page”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "/articles/?page=2&page_size=50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it’s useful:\n",
    "- some users want “show 100 per page”\n",
    "- internal admin tools often want bigger pages\n",
    "- API clients may want fewer items per request for speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it’s dangerous to expose without limits:\n",
    "- attackers can request huge page sizes (DoS vector)\n",
    "- your server may generate enormous responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Industry practice:\n",
    "- allow `page_size` but cap it (e.g., max 100)\n",

    "- stored by the browser,\n",
    "- associated with a domain,\n",
    "- sent automatically with requests (under rules).\n",
    "\n",
    "Server sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Set-Cookie: sessionid=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser later sends:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Cookie: sessionid=abc123\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.9.2 Why cookies are used for sessions\n",
    "HTTP is stateless by default. Cookies allow the server to “recognize” a browser\n",
    "between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Django sites use a cookie like `sessionid` to store a session identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.9.3 Sessions: where the state lives\n",
    "In a session-based system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Browser stores: session ID (small)\n",
    "- Server stores: session data (potentially larger)\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "sessionid = \"abc123\"\n",
    "server_session_store[\"abc123\"] = {\"user_id\": 9, \"cart\": [42, 99]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Django supports multiple session stores:\n",
    "- database-backed\n",
    "- cached (Redis/memcache)\n",
    "- file-based\n",
    "- signed cookies (data stored client-side but cryptographically signed)\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll learn the tradeoffs later; for now, remember:\n",
    "- **cookie identifies the session**\n",
    "- **session contains the state**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.9.4 Cookie security attributes (why they matter)\n",
    "- `HttpOnly`: prevents JS from reading the cookie (helps against XSS stealing).\n",
    "- `Secure`: cookie only sent over HTTPS (prevents leakage over HTTP).\n",
    "- `SameSite=Lax/Strict/None`: controls cross-site sending behavior (CSRF impact).\n",
    "\n",
    "Industry standard:\n",
    "- session cookies should be `HttpOnly` and `Secure` in production.\n",

    "## 1.10 REST Basics (Why APIs Often Look Like They Do)\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is a style of mapping resources to URLs and using HTTP methods consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GET /api/articles/` → list\n",
    "- `POST /api/articles/` → create\n",
    "- `GET /api/articles/42/` → retrieve\n",
    "- `PATCH /api/articles/42/` → update partial\n",
    "- `DELETE /api/articles/42/` → delete\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this is common:\n",
    "- consistent and predictable\n",
    "- tooling works well (docs, clients)\n",
    "- maps cleanly to CRUD in databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every API is purely REST, but most professional Django APIs follow these\n",
    "conventions (especially with Django REST Framework).\n",

    "## 1.11 Security Essentials (With Realistic “Why”)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.11.1 CSRF: why it exists (in plain language)\n",
    "Because browsers automatically attach cookies to requests, an attacker can trick a\n",
    "logged-in user’s browser into sending a request to your site.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSRF protection proves:\n",
    "- the request originated from pages your server rendered (or your JS app), not from\n",
    "  an attacker’s site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django’s CSRF protection:\n",
    "- expects a CSRF token in POST/unsafe requests\n",
    "- rejects requests without a valid token\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.11.2 XSS: what it is and why escaping matters\n",
    "XSS happens when untrusted input is inserted into HTML/JS in a way that executes as\n",
    "code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django templates auto-escape by default, which prevents many XSS cases. But you can\n",
    "still create XSS by:\n",
    "- marking unsafe strings as safe\n",
    "- inserting untrusted data into JS contexts incorrectly\n",
    "- rendering rich HTML from users without sanitization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.11.3 SQL injection: what it is and why ORM helps\n",
    "SQL injection occurs when user input is concatenated into SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django ORM prevents most injection because it parameterizes queries (sends values\n",
    "separately from SQL structure). But risk returns if you build raw SQL incorrectly.\n",
