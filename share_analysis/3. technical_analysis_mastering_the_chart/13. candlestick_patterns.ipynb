    "## Chapter 13: Candlestick Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter Objective:** Candlestick charts are the preferred visual tool of most modern technical analysts because they convey a wealth of information in a single intuitive image. This chapter provides a comprehensive guide to candlestick patterns—from basic single‑session formations to complex multi‑session reversal and continuation signals. You will learn the psychology behind each pattern, how to recognize them reliably, and how to integrate candlestick signals with trend analysis and other technical tools. By mastering candlesticks, you will gain deeper insight into the ongoing battle between buyers and sellers and improve your timing for entries and exits.\n",

    "### 13.1 The Anatomy of a Candlestick\n",
    "\n",
    "Candlestick charts originated in Japan over 300 years ago, used by rice traders. They were introduced to the Western world by Steve Nison in his book *Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques*. Each candlestick represents the price action for a specific period (day, week, hour, etc.) and consists of several parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components of a Candlestick:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real Body:** The rectangular area between the open and close. It represents the net price movement during the period.\n",
    "    - If the close is above the open, the body is typically white or green (bullish).\n",
    "    - If the close is below the open, the body is typically black or red (bearish).\n",
    "- **Upper Shadow (or Wick):** The thin line extending from the top of the real body to the period's high. It shows the highest price reached.\n",
    "- **Lower Shadow:** The thin line extending from the bottom of the real body to the period's low. It shows the lowest price reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation of Body and Shadow Lengths:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long real body** indicates strong buying (bullish) or selling (bearish) pressure.\n",
    "- **Short real body** indicates indecision or consolidation (e.g., doji, spinning top).\n",
    "- **Long upper shadow** suggests that buyers pushed prices up, but sellers forced them back down (rejection of higher prices).\n",
    "- **Long lower shadow** suggests that sellers pushed prices down, but buyers stepped in to push them back up (rejection of lower prices).\n",

    "### 13.2 Single‑Session Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Single candlestick patterns are formed by just one period's price action. They provide immediate clues about market sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Doji\n",
    "\n",
    "A doji occurs when the open and close are virtually equal, resulting in a very small real body. It signals indecision between buyers and sellers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Doji:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Doji:** Open and close equal, with shadows of any length.\n",
    "- **Long‑Legged Doji:** Long upper and lower shadows, indicating that price moved significantly in both directions but closed near the open—extreme indecision.\n",
    "- **Dragonfly Doji:** Long lower shadow, little or no upper shadow. Forms at the bottom of a downtrend, suggesting a potential reversal up (buyers stepped in after a sell‑off).\n",
    "- **Gravestone Doji:** Long upper shadow, little or no lower shadow. Forms at the top of an uptrend, suggesting a potential reversal down (sellers stepped in after a rally).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- A doji after a strong uptrend warns of a possible top.\n",
    "- A doji after a strong downtrend warns of a possible bottom.\n",
    "- Doji are more significant when they appear after a prolonged trend and when accompanied by high volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Marubozu\n",
    "\n",
    "A marubozu (Japanese for \"bald head\") has no shadows (or very small ones), meaning the open was the low (for a bullish marubozu) or the high (for a bearish marubozu).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **White Marubozu:** Long white body with no lower shadow (open = low) and no upper shadow (close = high). Indicates strong buying pressure from open to close.\n",
    "- **Black Marubozu:** Long black body with no upper shadow (open = high) and no lower shadow (close = low). Indicates strong selling pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hammer and Hanging Man\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns have the same shape: a small real body at the upper end of the trading range, with a long lower shadow (at least twice the length of the body) and little or no upper shadow. They are distinguished by their location in the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hammer:** Appears after a downtrend. The long lower shadow suggests that sellers pushed prices down, but buyers overwhelmed them and pushed prices back up, closing near the high. Bullish reversal signal.\n",
    "- **Hanging Man:** Appears after an uptrend. The same shape, but after a rally, it warns that selling pressure is emerging. Bearish reversal signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inverted Hammer and Shooting Star\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns have a small real body at the lower end of the trading range, with a long upper shadow and little or no lower shadow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inverted Hammer:** Appears after a downtrend. The long upper shadow indicates that buyers tried to push prices up, but sellers still have some control. However, it shows that buying interest is emerging. Needs confirmation on the next bar.\n",
    "- **Shooting Star:** Appears after an uptrend. The long upper shadow shows that buyers pushed prices higher, but sellers drove them back down, closing near the low. Bearish reversal signal.\n",

    "Two‑session patterns involve two consecutive candlesticks. They are more reliable than single‑session patterns because they show a shift in sentiment over two periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bullish Engulfing\n",
    "\n",
    "A two‑candle reversal pattern that occurs in a downtrend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Day 1:** A bearish (black/red) candle, continuing the downtrend.\n",
    "- **Day 2:** A bullish (white/green) candle that opens lower than the previous close but closes above the previous open, i.e., the real body completely \"engulfs\" the previous day's real body.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** The selling pressure is overcome by stronger buying pressure. A strong bullish reversal signal, especially if followed by higher prices on day 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bearish Engulfing\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite, occurring in an uptrend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Day 1:** A bullish candle.\n",
    "- **Day 2:** A bearish candle that opens higher than the previous close and closes below the previous open, engulfing the prior body.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** Strong bearish reversal signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Harami (and Harami Cross)\n",
    "\n",
    "Harami means \"pregnant\" in Japanese. It is the opposite of engulfing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bullish Harami:** Occurs in a downtrend. Day 1 is a long bearish candle; Day 2 is a small bullish candle (or doji) that trades entirely within the previous day's real body. It suggests that selling pressure is abating.\n",
    "- **Bearish Harami:** Occurs in an uptrend. Day 1 is a long bullish candle; Day 2 is a small bearish candle within the prior body. Suggests weakening of buying pressure.\n",
    "- **Harami Cross:** When the second day is a doji. More significant than a regular harami.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Piercing Line and Dark Cloud Cover\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Piercing Line (Bullish):** In a downtrend. Day 1: bearish candle. Day 2: bullish candle that opens lower but closes above the midpoint of Day 1's real body. Shows strong buying pressure overcoming selling.\n",
    "- **Dark Cloud Cover (Bearish):** In an uptrend. Day 1: bullish candle. Day 2: bearish candle that opens higher but closes below the midpoint of Day 1's real body. Shows strong selling pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tweezer Tops and Bottoms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tweezer Top:** Two consecutive candles with the same high. In an uptrend, it signals resistance and potential reversal.\n",

    "### 13.5 Integrating Candlesticks with Trend Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Candlestick patterns are most powerful when combined with the broader trend context. A hammer at the end of a downtrend is a much stronger signal than a hammer in the middle of a trading range. Similarly, an engulfing pattern in an overextended market (based on RSI or Bollinger Bands) carries more weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines for Integration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always consider the trend.** Use moving averages, trendlines, or higher time frame analysis to determine the dominant trend. Trade reversal patterns only when they align with a potential trend change.\n",
    "- **Look for confirmation.** A single candlestick pattern is not a signal to act; wait for the next candle to confirm (e.g., after a hammer, wait for a bullish close or a higher open).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Candlesticks provide a visual representation of the battle between buyers and sellers.** Each candle shows open, high, low, and close.\n",
    "- **Single‑session patterns** (doji, hammer, shooting star, marubozu) give immediate clues about sentiment and potential reversals.\n",
    "- **Two‑session patterns** (engulfing, harami, piercing, dark cloud) show a shift in sentiment over two periods and are more reliable.\n",
    "- **Three‑session patterns** (morning/evening star, three soldiers/crows, abandoned baby) provide strong reversal signals.\n",
    "- **Patterns must be interpreted in the context of the prevailing trend, support/resistance, and volume.** They are not standalone signals.\n",
    "- **Confirmation is key.** Wait for the next candle to confirm the pattern's implication.\n",
    "- **Combine candlestick patterns with other technical tools** (moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands) for higher probability setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Conceptual:** Draw a hammer and a shooting star. Explain the difference in their location within a trend and what each implies about market psychology.\n",
    "2.  **Practical:** Download daily data for a stock of your choice. Using the pattern detection code, identify all bullish engulfing patterns that occurred in the last year. For each, check whether the stock was higher 5 days later. What is your success rate?\n",
    "3.  **Research:** Find a real chart where a morning star pattern formed. Measure the subsequent price move. Was the pattern followed by a sustained reversal or just a short‑term bounce? What other factors (volume, trend, support) were present?\n",
    "4.  **Coding:** Enhance the pattern detection functions to incorporate a trend filter. For example, only flag a bullish engulfing if the stock is in a downtrend (price below 50‑day SMA). Then backtest this filtered strategy against the unfiltered version. Does filtering improve performance?\n",

    "Candlestick patterns, combined with the indicators from Chapter 12, provide a robust technical toolkit. However, there are even more advanced theories that some traders use to gain an edge. In Chapter 14, we will explore Elliott Wave Theory, Fibonacci retracements and extensions, Point and Figure charting, and the critical concept of confirmation. These advanced tools can help you anticipate price targets and understand the underlying structure of market movements."
