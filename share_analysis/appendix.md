## Appendix I: 30 Golden Rules of Investing

These rules distill the wisdom of successful investors into actionable principles. They are not rigid laws but guidelines to help you maintain discipline and avoid common pitfalls.

### The Rules

1.  **Invest in what you understand.** Never buy a business whose products, customers, or economics you cannot explain in simple terms. (Buffett's circle of competence)

2.  **Think like an owner, not a trader.** When you buy a share, you are buying a piece of a business. Focus on its long‑term value, not short‑term price fluctuations.

3.  **Margin of safety is everything.** Always buy with a cushion. If intrinsic value is $100, try to buy at $70 or less. This protects against errors and bad luck.

4.  **The market is a pendulum, not a weighing machine.** Prices swing between fear and greed. Use Mr. Market's moods to your advantage – buy when he's fearful, sell when he's euphoric.

5.  **Diversification is the only free lunch.** By holding uncorrelated assets, you can reduce risk without sacrificing expected return. But don't overdiversify into mediocrity.

6.  **Focus on the process, not the outcome.** A good decision can have a bad outcome, and vice versa. Judge your success by whether you followed your disciplined process.

7.  **Keep costs low.** Fees, taxes, and trading costs compound into large drags on returns. Use low‑cost ETFs for core holdings, and minimise turnover.

8.  **Let your winners run, and cut your losers short.** The disposition effect (selling winners too early and holding losers too long) destroys value. Set pre‑determined exit rules.

9.  **Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.** Contrarian sentiment indicators (VIX, put/call ratios) can help identify extremes.

10. **No one can consistently predict the short‑term direction of the market.** Time in the market beats timing the market. Stay invested according to your plan.

11. **The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the second‑best time is now.** Don't wait for the perfect entry – if a stock is attractive, start building a position gradually.

12. **Read annual reports, not just stock screens.** The footnotes and management's discussion reveal more than the numbers. Look for red flags.

13. **Ignore the noise.** Daily news, analyst upgrades/downgrades, and social media chatter are mostly distractions. Focus on the underlying business.

14. **Have a checklist.** Before any purchase, run through your investment checklist to ensure you haven't overlooked critical factors.

15. **Position size matters.** Never risk more than you can afford to lose on a single idea. Use fractional risk (e.g., 1‑2% of portfolio) to size positions.

16. **Use stop‑losses, but place them wisely.** Avoid round numbers; place stops below support levels or based on volatility (e.g., 2× ATR).

17. **Rebalance periodically.** Selling winners and buying losers forces you to buy low and sell high, maintaining your target asset allocation.

18. **Know the difference between price and value.** Price is what you pay; value is what you get. Volatility is not the same as risk.

19. **Beware of debt.** A company with too much debt is fragile. In good times it amplifies returns, in bad times it can destroy the business.

20. **Management matters.** Look for aligned, capable, and honest leaders. Check insider ownership and capital allocation history.

21. **Earnings can be manipulated; cash flow is harder to fake.** Focus on free cash flow as a measure of true profitability.

22. **Growth and value are joined at the hip.** Value without growth is a value trap; growth at any price can lead to losses. Seek growth at a reasonable price (GARP).

23. **The best businesses generate high returns on invested capital (ROIC) and reinvest at those high rates.** Look for consistent ROE/ROIC above 15‑20%.

24. **Don't fight the trend.** In technical analysis, the trend is your friend. Avoid shorting strong uptrends or buying into clear downtrends.

25. **Confirmation is key.** A single indicator is not enough. Combine fundamental, technical, and sentiment signals before acting.

26. **Understand the macroeconomic environment, but don't bet on it.** Interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth affect sectors differently, but macro forecasting is hard.

27. **Never invest in something you don't understand just because the price is rising.** FOMO (fear of missing out) leads to buying at tops.

28. **Keep a trading journal.** Record your reasons for entry and exit, your emotional state, and the outcome. Review regularly to learn from mistakes.

29. **Taxes matter.** Hold investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long‑term capital gains rates. Use tax‑advantaged accounts where possible.

30. **The most important rule: Never lose money.** (Rule 2: Never forget rule 1.) – Warren Buffett.
