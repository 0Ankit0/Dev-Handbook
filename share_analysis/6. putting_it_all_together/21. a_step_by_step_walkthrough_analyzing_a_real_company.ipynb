    "## Chapter 21: A Step‑by‑Step Walkthrough: Analyzing a Real Company\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter Objective:** This chapter brings together every concept and tool from the previous chapters in a comprehensive, real‑world analysis. We will walk through the entire process of analyzing a publicly traded company—from initial idea generation to final investment decision. Using Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) as our case study, we will apply fundamental analysis, valuation techniques, technical analysis, risk assessment, and portfolio considerations. By the end, you will see how a professional analyst synthesizes diverse information into a disciplined, actionable investment thesis.\n",

    "**Screen Criteria:**\n",
    "- Large‑cap technology company (market cap > $500B)\n",
    "- Revenue growth > 10% (last 12 months)\n",
    "- Return on Equity (ROE) > 20%\n",
    "- P/E ratio < 30\n",
    "- Positive free cash flow\n",

    "1.  **Productivity and Business Processes:** Office, LinkedIn, Dynamics.\n",
    "2.  **Intelligent Cloud:** Azure, server products, enterprise services.\n",
    "3.  **More Personal Computing:** Windows, devices (Surface), gaming (Xbox), search advertising.\n",

    "**Industry Analysis (Porter's Five Forces):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Threat of New Entrants:** Moderate – cloud infrastructure requires massive capital, but software niches can be disrupted.\n",
    "- **Supplier Power:** Low – Microsoft develops its own software; hardware components are commoditized.\n",
    "- **Buyer Power:** Moderate – large enterprise customers have negotiating power, but switching costs (Office, Azure) are high.\n",
    "- **Threat of Substitutes:** Moderate – open‑source alternatives, but ecosystem lock‑in protects.\n",
    "- **Rivalry:** Intense – competition from Amazon (AWS), Google (Cloud, Workspace), Apple, etc., but Microsoft's diversified moat is strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic Moat:** Microsoft enjoys multiple moats – brand, switching costs (Office, Windows), network effects (LinkedIn, developer ecosystem), and scale advantages in cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Management Quality:** Satya Nadella (CEO since 2014) has a strong track record of pivoting to cloud and fostering a culture of innovation. Capital allocation includes consistent dividends and buybacks, and strategic acquisitions (GitHub, LinkedIn, Activision Blizzard).\n",
