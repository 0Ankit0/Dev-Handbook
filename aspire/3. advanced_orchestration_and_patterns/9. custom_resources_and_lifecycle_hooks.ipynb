    "## Chapter 9: Custom Resources and Lifecycle Hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters, you’ve used Aspire’s built‑in resource types—projects, containers, databases, etc.—to model your application. But what if you need a resource that isn’t one of the standard ones? Perhaps you need to run a custom setup script, wait for a third‑party service to be ready, or coordinate the startup order in a more fine‑grained way. Aspire’s extensibility model allows you to create **custom resources** and hook into the application lifecycle with **lifecycle hooks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you’ll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to create a custom resource type.\n",
    "- How to attach metadata using annotations.\n",
    "- How to implement lifecycle hooks (`BeforeStart`, `AfterResourcesCreated`) to execute custom logic.\n",
    "- How to run database migrations automatically before your API starts.\n",
    "- How to model complex dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you’ll be able to extend Aspire’s orchestrator to fit any bespoke requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.1 Beyond Built‑in Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The built‑in resources (`AddProject`, `AddContainer`, `AddPostgres`, etc.) cover many common scenarios. However, you might need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A resource representing a custom tool or script.\n",
    "- A resource that waits for an external condition (e.g., a cloud service to be provisioned).\n",
    "- A resource that groups other resources together.\n",
    "- A resource that performs an action (like database migration) rather than running continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aspire allows you to define your own resource types by implementing the `IResource` interface or deriving from `Resource`. You then add them to the application model using `AddResource`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.2 Creating a Custom Resource\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create a custom resource that represents a **database migration** task. This resource won’t run continuously; instead, it will execute a migration script (using EF Core) and then complete. We want the API project to depend on this migration resource, so that the API starts only after migrations have run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Define the Custom Resource Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new class in the AppHost project (or a shared project) called `MigrationResource.cs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace MyAspireApp.AppHost;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class MigrationResource : Resource\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public MigrationResource(string name) : base(name)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple class derives from `Resource`, which gives it a name and the ability to have annotations. We’ll add more later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Add an Extension Method for Easy Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an extension method so we can write `builder.AddMigration(\"migration\")` in a fluent way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace Aspire.Hosting;\n",
    "\n",
    "public static class MigrationResourceBuilderExtensions\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static IResourceBuilder<MigrationResource> AddMigration(\n",
    "        this IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder,\n",
    "        string name)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        var resource = new MigrationResource(name);\n",
    "        return builder.AddResource(resource)\n",
    "                      .WithInitialState(new CustomResourceSnapshot\n",
    "                      {\n",
    "                          ResourceType = \"Migration\",\n",
    "                          State = \"Not started\",\n",
    "                          Properties = []\n",
    "                      });\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WithInitialState` call sets an initial state for the dashboard, so the resource appears with a custom type and status.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Use the Custom Resource in AppHost\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Program.cs`, add the migration resource and make the API depend on it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var migration = builder.AddMigration(\"migration\");\n",
    "\n",
    "var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyAspireApp_ApiService>(\"apiservice\")\n",
    "    .WithReference(migration)   // This creates a dependency\n",
    "    .WithReference(productsDb)\n",
    "    .WithReference(messaging)\n",
    "    .WithReference(blobs);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the API will not start until the migration resource is considered “running”. But our migration resource currently does nothing. We need to add behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.3 Lifecycle Hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Lifecycle hooks allow you to execute code at specific points during the application’s startup and shutdown. The main hooks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BeforeStart**: Executed before any resources are started. Good for validating configuration or preparing the environment.\n",
    "- **AfterResourcesCreated**: Executed after all resources have been created (i.e., their underlying processes/containers are running). This is perfect for running one‑time setup tasks that depend on other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use lifecycle hooks, you attach an **annotation** that implements `ILifecycleHook` to your resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.3.1 Implementing a Lifecycle Hook\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class that implements `IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook`. You can override methods like `BeforeStartAsync` and `AfterResourcesCreatedAsync`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle;\n",
    "using Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace MyAspireApp.AppHost;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class MigrationLifecycleHook : IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public Task BeforeStartAsync(DistributedApplicationModel appModel, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // You could validate something here\n",
    "        return Task.CompletedTask;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Task AfterResourcesCreatedAsync(DistributedApplicationModel appModel, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Here we can run migrations\n",
    "        return Task.CompletedTask;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But we need this hook to be specific to our `MigrationResource`. The `appModel` contains all resources. We can find our migration resource and then execute the migration logic. However, we also need to wait for the database resource to be ready (since migrations need a database). This is where annotations help.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.3.2 Attaching the Lifecycle Hook to the Resource\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t want the hook to run for every resource; we only want it to run for our specific migration resource. So we’ll create a custom annotation that holds the logic, and then attach it to the resource. Then, in a global lifecycle hook, we can look for resources with that annotation and execute them.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, define an annotation interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public interface IMigrationExecutor\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Task ExecuteMigrationAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then create a class that implements this interface and also holds a reference to the resource and its dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace MyAspireApp.AppHost;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class MigrationExecutorAnnotation : IMigrationExecutor\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly MigrationResource _resource;\n",
    "    private readonly DistributedApplicationModel _model;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public MigrationExecutorAnnotation(MigrationResource resource, DistributedApplicationModel model)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _resource = resource;\n",
    "        _model = model;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public async Task ExecuteMigrationAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Find the database connection string from the API service's references\n",
    "        // We need to locate the API service that references this migration.\n",
    "        // But a more robust way: have the migration resource reference the database directly.\n",
    "        // Let's assume the migration resource also references the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "        // For simplicity, we'll just run a command in the API project.\n",
    "        // In reality, you'd run `dotnet ef database update` against the API project.\n",
    "\n",
    "        var apiService = _model.Resources.OfType<ProjectResource>()\n",
    "            .FirstOrDefault(r => r.Name == \"apiservice\");\n",

    "        // This is tricky because environment variables are set after resources start.\n",

    "\n",
    "        // We'll retrieve the connection string from the database resource.\n",
    "        var dbResource = _model.Resources.OfType<PostgresDatabaseResource>()\n",

    "### 9.5 Using WithAnnotation for Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotations are key‑value pairs attached to resources. They can hold any metadata you need. For example, you might annotate a resource with a version number, or with a flag indicating whether it should be exposed publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add an annotation using `WithAnnotation<T>`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyAspireApp_ApiService>(\"apiservice\")\n",
    "    .WithAnnotation(new EndpointAnnotation(ProtocolType.Http, uriScheme: \"http\", name: \"public\"))\n",
    "    .WithAnnotation(new MyCustomAnnotation { SomeValue = 123 });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then later, in a lifecycle hook or elsewhere, you can retrieve annotations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var customAnnotation = resource.Annotations.OfType<MyCustomAnnotation>().FirstOrDefault();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotations are powerful for extending the resource model without creating new resource types.\n",

    "### 9.6 Hands‑on: Create a Migration Resource for EF Core\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's implement the migration resource in our `MyAspireApp` solution. We’ll use Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Add EF Core to the API Service\n",
    "\n",
    "In the API service project, install EF Core and the Npgsql provider:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd MyAspireApp.ApiService\n",
    "dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design\n",
    "dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `DbContext` and entity models. For simplicity, we'll reuse the `Product` and `Order` classes but set up EF Core.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create `AppDbContext.cs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace MyAspireApp.ApiService.Data;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class AppDbContext : DbContext\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public AppDbContext(DbContextOptions<AppDbContext> options) : base(options) { }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }\n",
    "    public DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; }\n",
    "    public DbSet<OrderItem> OrderItems { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        modelBuilder.Entity<Product>().ToTable(\"Products\");\n",
    "        modelBuilder.Entity<Order>().ToTable(\"Orders\");\n",
    "        modelBuilder.Entity<OrderItem>().ToTable(\"OrderItems\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Update `Program.cs` to register EF Core with the connection string. But note: we want migrations to be run by the migration resource, so we need to ensure the connection string is available. We'll register `DbContext` after obtaining the connection string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Program.cs`, replace the raw `NpgsqlDataSource` registration with EF Core:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// Build connection string from configuration (as we did in Chapter 7)\n",
    "var dbHost = builder.Configuration[\"Database:Host\"] ?? \"localhost\";\n",
    "var dbPort = builder.Configuration[\"Database:Port\"] ?? \"5432\";\n",
    "var dbName = builder.Configuration[\"Database:Name\"] ?? \"shop\";\n",
    "var dbUser = builder.Configuration[\"Database:User\"] ?? \"postgres\";\n",
    "var dbPassword = builder.Configuration[\"Database:Password\"];\n",
    "\n",
    "var connectionString = $\"Host={dbHost};Port={dbPort};Database={dbName};Username={dbUser};Password={dbPassword}\";\n",
    "\n",
    "builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>\n",
    "    options.UseNpgsql(connectionString));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of raw SQL, use the DbContext in endpoints. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.MapGet(\"/products\", async (AppDbContext db) =>\n",
    "    await db.Products.ToListAsync());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Add Migration Tools and Create Initial Migration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the API service project, add a reference to the EF Core tools (if not already) and create a migration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools\n",
    "dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a `Migrations` folder. We want our migration resource to run `dotnet ef database update` against this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Implement the Custom Resource in AppHost\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps outlined earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create `MigrationResource` class.\n",
    "- Create extension method `AddMigration` that takes database and project references.\n",
    "- Create `MigrationLifecycleHook` that runs `dotnet ef database update` with the connection string.\n",
    "- Register the lifecycle hook in `Program.cs`.\n",

However, our migration runs in `AfterResourcesCreatedAsync`, which happens after all resources are created. The API resource will be in a \"Starting\" state while the migration runs. The dependency will ensure the API does not start until the migration is considered \"running\". Since our migration quickly completes, the API will start after.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Custom resources** allow you to model any component of your application, not just the built‑in ones.\n",
    "- **Annotations** (like `WithReference`, `WithAnnotation`) attach metadata to resources, which can be retrieved later.\n",
    "- **Lifecycle hooks** (`BeforeStart`, `AfterResourcesCreated`) let you run code at specific points in the application startup.\n",
    "- You built a practical `MigrationResource` that runs EF Core migrations before the API starts, ensuring the database schema is up‑to‑date.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques give you the power to adapt Aspire to any complex scenario. In the next chapter, we’ll dive into **Advanced Service Discovery and Resiliency**, where you’ll learn how to fine‑tune service communication, implement custom load balancing, and use advanced Polly policies.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the migration resource to wait for the database to be healthy before running migrations (hint: use `IResourceBuilder.WaitFor` or a health check check).\n",
    "2. Create a custom resource that seeds the database with initial data after migrations complete.\n",
    "3. Add a lifecycle hook that logs all environment variables injected into each project (for debugging purposes).\n",
    "4. Explore the `ResourceNotificationService` and update the migration resource’s state with a progress message.\n",
