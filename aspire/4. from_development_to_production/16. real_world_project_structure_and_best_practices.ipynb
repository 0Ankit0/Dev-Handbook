    "### 16.1 Organizing a Large\u2011Scale Aspire Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "As your application grows, the single\u2011solution model with one AppHost may become unwieldy. Consider a scenario with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple teams owning different sets of services.\n",
    "- Different release cadences for different parts of the system.\n",
    "- Shared libraries (e.g., contracts, service defaults) that need versioning.\n",
    "- Multiple environments (dev, test, staging, production) that may require slightly different resource configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.1.1 Multiple AppHosts\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have **multiple AppHost projects** in a single repository, each targeting a subset of services. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `AppHost.Development`: starts all services and dependencies for full\u2011stack development.\n",
    "- `AppHost.PaymentTeam`: starts only payment\u2011related services and their dependencies.\n",
    "- `AppHost.IntegrationTests`: a trimmed\u2011down AppHost for fast test execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each AppHost references the same underlying service projects but may include different resources or configurations. This is achieved by having separate `Program.cs` files that add only the required resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example directory structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/src\n",
    "  /Services\n",
    "    /PaymentService\n",
    "    /OrderService\n",
    "    /InventoryService\n",
    "  /AppHosts\n",
    "    /AppHost.Dev\n",
    "    /AppHost.Payment\n",
    "    /AppHost.Testing\n",
    "  /ServiceDefaults\n",
    "  /Contracts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each AppHost has its own project file that references the necessary service projects and the `ServiceDefaults` project. This keeps the orchestration layer flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.1.2 Shared Service Defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have multiple service default projects if different parts of your organization have different requirements. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ServiceDefaults.Core`: basic telemetry, health checks, and resilience.\n",
    "- `ServiceDefaults.Azure`: adds Azure\u2011specific components (like Key Vault integration).\n",
    "- `ServiceDefaults.PCI`: adds additional security and compliance checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Services can then reference the appropriate defaults. This modularity prevents a single monolithic defaults project from becoming a dumping ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.1.3 Contracts and Shared Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When services communicate, they often share data contracts (e.g., DTOs, event schemas). It\u2019s best to put these in a separate **Contracts** project that is versioned independently. This project can be published as a NuGet package, allowing multiple services (even across repositories) to reference the same contract types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<!-- Contracts.csproj -->\n",
    "<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n",
    "  <PropertyGroup>\n",
    "    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\n",
    "    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n",
    "  </PropertyGroup>\n",
    "</Project>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in each service:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<ProjectReference Include=\"../../Contracts/Contracts.csproj\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if using NuGet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<PackageReference Include=\"MyCompany.ECommerce.Contracts\" Version=\"1.2.3\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.1.4 Component Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "If you develop custom Aspire components internally (e.g., for your own databases or legacy systems), place them in a dedicated `Components` folder and package them as NuGet. This promotes reuse across teams and solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.2 Versioning Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Versioning is critical when you have multiple services that evolve independently. You need to version:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **APIs**: the HTTP/gRPC interfaces between services.\n",
    "- **Messages**: the event schemas.\n",
    "- **Components**: the NuGet packages your services depend on.\n",
    "- **The overall application**: for release tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.2.1 API Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Use ASP.NET Core API versioning to manage changes to your HTTP APIs. There are several approaches: URL path versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/products`), query string versioning, or header versioning. Choose one and be consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with URL path versioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// In Program.cs\n",
    "builder.Services.AddApiVersioning(options =>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    options.DefaultApiVersion = new ApiVersion(1, 0);\n",
    "    options.AssumeDefaultVersionWhenUnspecified = true;\n",
    "    options.ReportApiVersions = true;\n",
    "    options.ApiVersionReader = new UrlSegmentApiVersionReader();\n",
    "})\n",
    ".AddApiExplorer(options =>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    options.GroupNameFormat = \"'v'VVV\";\n",
    "    options.SubstituteApiVersionInUrl = true;\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in controllers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[ApiVersion(\"1.0\")]\n",
    "[Route(\"api/v{version:apiVersion}/[controller]\")]\n",
    "public class ProductsController : ControllerBase\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.2.2 Message Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "For events, use a schema registry or include a version number in the message envelope. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"eventType\": \"OrderCreated\",\n",
    "  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n",
    "  \"data\": { ... }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumers can then handle different versions appropriately. Consider using **CloudEvents** standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.2.3 Component Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "All shared NuGet packages (contracts, components, service defaults) should follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). This allows services to upgrade independently as long as the major version matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your CI pipeline, you can automatically version packages based on git tags or build numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.3 CI/CD Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "A robust CI/CD pipeline is essential for frequent, reliable deployments. Let\u2019s build a pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Builds all services and runs unit tests.\n",
    "- Runs integration tests using the `Aspire.Hosting.Testing` approach.\n",
    "- Builds and pushes container images.\n",
    "- Deploys to a target environment (e.g., Azure Container Apps).\n",
    "\n",
    "We\u2019ll use **GitHub Actions** as an example, but the concepts apply to Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.3.1 Building and Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a workflow file `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "name: CI\n",
    "\n",
    "on:\n",
    "  push:\n",
    "    branches: [ main ]\n",
    "  pull_request:\n",
    "    branches: [ main ]\n",
    "\n",
    "jobs:\n",
    "  build:\n",
    "    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n",
    "    steps:\n",
    "    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n",
    "    - name: Setup .NET\n",
    "      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n",
    "      with:\n",
    "        dotnet-version: 8.0.x\n",
    "    - name: Restore\n",
    "      run: dotnet restore\n",
    "    - name: Build\n",
    "      run: dotnet build --no-restore\n",
    "    - name: Test\n",
    "      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This runs unit tests but not integration tests (which require Docker). For integration tests, we need a runner that supports Docker. GitHub Actions hosted runners have Docker installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a step to run integration tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "    - name: Integration Tests\n",
    "      run: dotnet test MyAspireApp.Tests --configuration Release --no-build\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your integration tests are designed to be run in CI: they should use the same AppHost but may need to pull container images. The first run may be slow, but subsequent runs are cached.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.3.2 Building and Pushing Container Images\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build images using `docker build` or use `azd` to handle it. For GitHub Actions, you might want to push to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ACR).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, log in to the registry:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "    - name: Log in to Azure Container Registry\n",
    "      uses: azure/docker-login@v1\n",
    "      with:\n",
    "        login-server: myregistry.azurecr.io\n",
    "        username: ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }}\n",
    "        password: ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then build and push images for each service. You can use a script or a matrix strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, use `azd` to handle the entire deployment, including building and pushing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.3.3 Deploying with AZD\n",
    "\n",
    "If you\u2019re using Azure Container Apps, `azd` is the simplest deployment tool. In your pipeline, you can install `azd` and run `azd up` or `azd deploy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "    - name: Install azd\n",
    "      uses: Azure/setup-azd@v1\n",
    "\n",
    "    - name: Deploy\n",
    "      env:\n",
    "        AZURE_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}\n",
    "        AZURE_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}\n",
    "        AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}\n",
    "      run: azd up --environment production\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ll need to set up a service principal for authentication and store its credentials in GitHub secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.3.4 Deploying with aspirate\n",
    "\n",
    "If you\u2019re deploying to Kubernetes, you can use `aspirate` to generate manifests and then `kubectl` to apply them. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "    - name: Install aspirate\n",
    "      run: dotnet tool install -g aspirate\n",
    "\n",
    "    - name: Generate Kubernetes manifests\n",
    "      run: aspirate generate --manifest-path ./aspire-manifest.json --output-path ./manifests\n",
    "\n",
    "    - name: Deploy to Kubernetes\n",
    "      run: kubectl apply -f ./manifests/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ll need to configure `kubectl` with the appropriate kubeconfig.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.3.5 Running Migrations in Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Database migrations should be run as part of the deployment. You can include a migration step that runs the migration resource or a separate job. With `azd`, you can add a hook to run migrations after deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.4 Pitfalls to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with Aspire\u2019s simplicity, certain issues can trip you up. Here are common pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.4.1 Service Discovery Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: A service can\u2019t reach another because the logical name is misspelled or the environment variables aren\u2019t set.\n",
    "- **Solution**: Always use the exact logical name defined in the AppHost. Check that `WithReference` is used correctly. In Kubernetes, ensure that the service names match (they should, because `aspirate` names them after the resource).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.4.2 Container Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: Containers can\u2019t communicate because they\u2019re on different networks.\n",
    "- **Solution**: In the AppHost, all containers are on the same default network, so this shouldn\u2019t happen. In Kubernetes, services are discoverable via DNS. In ACA, internal DNS works within the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.4.3 Resource Naming Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: Two resources with the same logical name in different AppHosts cause confusion.\n",
    "- **Solution**: Use unique prefixes or namespaces. In large organizations, adopt a naming convention (e.g., `team-product-service`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.4.4 Parameter Handling in CI\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: CI builds fail because parameters (like passwords) are not provided.\n",
    "- **Solution**: Use environment variables or secrets in the CI system. In `azd`, parameters can be set in `.env` files or passed via `--set` flag. In GitHub Actions, store secrets and map them to environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.4.5 Health Checks Not Configured\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: Services appear healthy in the dashboard but fail in production because health checks aren\u2019t mapped.\n",
    "- **Solution**: Always map health check endpoints in your services, and configure liveness/readiness probes in your production orchestrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.4.6 Inefficient Dockerfiles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: Dockerfiles that copy entire solutions and rebuild everything slow down CI.\n",
    "- **Solution**: Use multi\u2011stage builds and leverage Docker layer caching. Organize your Dockerfiles to copy only the necessary project files first, restore, then copy the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.4.7 Not Using IHostedService for Workers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: Worker services that don\u2019t implement `BackgroundService` correctly may exit prematurely.\n",
    "- **Solution**: Ensure your worker services derive from `BackgroundService` and have an infinite loop or wait for cancellation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.5 Hands\u2011on: Setting Up a Multi\u2011AppHost Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\u2019s restructure our e\u2011commerce solution to demonstrate these concepts. We\u2019ll create two AppHosts: one for full development (`AppHost.Dev`) and one for the payment team (`AppHost.Payment`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create the AppHost Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "In the solution root, create a folder `AppHosts`. Inside, create two new ASP.NET Core Empty projects (targeting .NET 8) named `AppHost.Dev` and `AppHost.Payment`. Add the Aspire.Hosting package to each.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet new web -n AppHost.Dev -f net8.0\n",
    "dotnet new web -n AppHost.Payment -f net8.0\n",
    "cd AppHost.Dev\n",
    "dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting\n",
    "dotnet add reference ../../MyAspireApp.ServiceDefaults  # if needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Do the same for `AppHost.Payment`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Configure AppHost.Dev\n",
    "\n",
    "In `AppHost.Dev/Program.cs`, add all services and dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Aspire.Hosting;\n",
    "\n",
    "var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n",
    "\n",
    "// Infrastructure\n",
    "var postgres = builder.AddPostgres(\"postgres\").WithDataVolume();\n",
    "var productsDb = postgres.AddDatabase(\"productsdb\");\n",
    "var rabbitMq = builder.AddRabbitMQ(\"messaging\").WithManagementPlugin();\n",
    "var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage(\"storage\").RunAsEmulator();\n",
    "var blobs = storage.AddBlobs(\"productimages\");\n",
    "var keycloak = builder.AddKeycloak(\"keycloak\", 8080).WithDataVolume();\n",
    "\n",
    "// Services\n",
    "var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyAspireApp_ApiService>(\"apiservice\")\n",
    "    .WithReference(productsDb)\n",
    "    .WithReference(rabbitMq)\n",
    "    .WithReference(blobs)\n",
    "    .WithReference(keycloak);\n",
    "\n",
    "var workerService = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyAspireApp_WorkerService>(\"workerservice\")\n",
    "    .WithReference(rabbitMq)\n",
    "    .WithReference(productsDb);\n",
    "\n",
    "var webFrontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyAspireApp_Web>(\"webfrontend\")\n",
    "    .WithReference(apiService)\n",
    "    .WithReference(keycloak);\n",
    "\n",
    "builder.Build().Run();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Configure AppHost.Payment\n",
    "\n",
    "This AppHost might only include payment\u2011related services. For example, assume we have a `PaymentService` and it depends only on RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Aspire.Hosting;\n",
    "\n",
    "var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n",
    "\n",
    "var postgres = builder.AddPostgres(\"postgres\").WithDataVolume();\n",
    "var paymentsDb = postgres.AddDatabase(\"paymentsdb\");\n",
    "var rabbitMq = builder.AddRabbitMQ(\"messaging\").WithManagementPlugin();\n",
    "\n",
    "var paymentService = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyAspireApp_PaymentService>(\"paymentservice\")\n",
    "    .WithReference(paymentsDb)\n",
    "    .WithReference(rabbitMq);\n",
    "\n",
    "builder.Build().Run();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the payment team to work in isolation without starting all other services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Share Contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `Contracts` project with shared DTOs. For example, a `PaymentCompletedEvent` that both the payment service and order service use. Reference this project from both services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Update CI Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the CI pipeline to build both AppHosts and run integration tests for each. You may also want to build and push images only for the services that changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.6 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final chapter, we covered the organizational and operational best practices that turn a simple Aspire demo into a production\u2011ready, enterprise\u2011scale system. You learned:\n",

    "1. Refactor your e\u2011commerce solution to use a separate `Contracts` project. Move all shared DTOs and event classes into it. Update service references.\n",
    "2. Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the solution, runs integration tests (using the test AppHost), and deploys to a staging environment using `azd`.\n",
    "3. Create a versioned API endpoint in the API service (e.g., `/api/v2/products`) that returns a different response. Use API versioning to route requests.\n",
    "4. Implement a dead\u2011letter queue strategy for RabbitMQ messages that fail processing. Configure the worker to move messages to a DLQ after 3 retries.\n",
