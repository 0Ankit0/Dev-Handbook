    "## Chapter 6: Messaging and Event\u2011Driven Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern distributed systems often rely on **messaging** to decouple services, improve resilience, and enable asynchronous processing. Instead of one service calling another directly via HTTP (synchronous communication), services can publish **events** to a message broker, and other services can consume those events at their own pace. This pattern is known as **event\u2011driven architecture**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we\u2019ll explore how .NET Aspire simplifies integrating message brokers like RabbitMQ and Azure Service Bus. You\u2019ll learn how to model these resources in the AppHost, connect them to your services using components, and implement a complete order processing workflow. By the end, you\u2019ll be able to build decoupled, scalable systems with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Why Messaging?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our e\u2011commerce example so far, the web frontend calls the API directly (HTTP). That\u2019s fine for simple requests, but consider what happens when a customer places an order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The API must validate the order.\n",
    "- It must update inventory.\n",
    "- It must send a confirmation email.\n",
    "- It might need to notify a shipping service.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do all this synchronously in the HTTP request, the customer waits a long time, and any failure (like the email server being down) could cause the entire order to fail. With messaging, the API can publish an `OrderCreated` event and return immediately. Other services (inventory, email, shipping) consume that event asynchronously. This decouples the services and makes the system more resilient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decoupling**: Services don\u2019t need to know about each other.\n",
    "- **Resilience**: If a consumer is down, messages wait in the queue until it recovers.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: You can run multiple instances of a consumer to process messages in parallel.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: New consumers can be added without changing the publisher.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Messaging Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common patterns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Queues**: A point\u2011to\u2011point channel. A message is sent to a queue and consumed by exactly one consumer (competing consumers pattern).\n",
    "- **Topics/Exchanges**: A publish/subscribe channel. A message is published to a topic and delivered to all subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "RabbitMQ uses **exchanges** and **queues**; Azure Service Bus uses **queues** and **topics/subscriptions**. Aspire components support both.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Recap: Adding RabbitMQ to the AppHost\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 4, we added RabbitMQ to our solution. Let\u2019s recap the AppHost configuration with a bit more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, ensure you have the `Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMQ` package installed in the AppHost project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd MyAspireApp.AppHost\n",
    "dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMQ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in `Program.cs`, add a RabbitMQ resource:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Aspire.Hosting;\n",
    "\n",
    "var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add RabbitMQ container\n",
    "var messaging = builder.AddRabbitMQ(\"messaging\")\n",
    "    .WithManagementPlugin(); // Enables the RabbitMQ management UI at port 15672\n",
    "\n",
    "// Existing resources\n",
    "var postgres = builder.AddPostgres(\"postgres\").WithDataVolume();\n",
    "var productsDb = postgres.AddDatabase(\"productsdb\");\n",
    "\n",
    "var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyAspireApp_ApiService>(\"apiservice\")\n",
    "    .WithReference(productsDb)\n",
    "    .WithReference(messaging);   // Give the API a connection to RabbitMQ\n",
    "\n",
    "var workerService = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyAspireApp_WorkerService>(\"workerservice\")\n",
    "    .WithReference(messaging);   // Worker also needs RabbitMQ\n",
    "\n",
    "var webfrontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyAspireApp_Web>(\"webfrontend\")\n",
    "    .WithReference(apiService);\n",
    "\n",
    "builder.Build().Run();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- `AddRabbitMQ(\"messaging\")` adds a container running the RabbitMQ image. The logical name is `\"messaging\"`.\n",
    "- `WithManagementPlugin()` adds the management UI (useful for development). The UI is available at `http://localhost:15672` (default credentials: guest/guest).\n",
    "- `WithReference(messaging)` injects the RabbitMQ connection string into both the API and worker services as `ConnectionStrings__messaging`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4 Adding the RabbitMQ Client Component\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually use RabbitMQ in your services, you need the client component. In both the API and worker projects, add the `Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ../MyAspireApp.ApiService\n",
    "dotnet add package Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client\n",
    "\n",
    "cd ../MyAspireApp.WorkerService\n",
    "dotnet add package Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In each service\u2019s `Program.cs`, add the RabbitMQ client registration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// In ApiService/Program.cs and WorkerService/Program.cs\n",
    "builder.AddRabbitMQClient(\"messaging\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reads the connection string from configuration (injected by the AppHost).\n",
    "- Registers `IConnection` and `IChannel` (or `IAsyncConnectionFactory` etc.) in DI.\n",
    "- Adds health checks (a check that can connect to RabbitMQ).\n",
    "- Adds OpenTelemetry instrumentation (traces for publish/consume operations, metrics for queue sizes etc.).\n",
    "- Optionally configures resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now your services can inject `IConnection` and start publishing or consuming messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5 Implementing an Order Processing Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\u2019s build a realistic order processing flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The API receives an order (via a new `POST /orders` endpoint).\n",
    "2. It saves the order to the database.\n",
    "3. It publishes an `OrderCreated` message to RabbitMQ.\n",
    "4. The worker service consumes `OrderCreated` messages and processes them (e.g., updates inventory, sends email).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.5.1 Define the Order Model and Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In the API service, add an `Order` class and an `OrderItem` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// ApiService/Models/Order.cs\n",
    "namespace MyAspireApp.ApiService.Models;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Order\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public int Id { get; set; }\n",
    "    public string CustomerName { get; set; } = string.Empty;\n",
    "    public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }\n",
    "    public decimal TotalAmount { get; set; }\n",
    "    public List<OrderItem> Items { get; set; } = new();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class OrderItem\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public int Id { get; set; }\n",
    "    public int ProductId { get; set; }\n",
    "    public int Quantity { get; set; }\n",
    "    public decimal UnitPrice { get; set; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We\u2019ll need a table for orders. Extend the database initialization in `Program.cs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();\n",
    "var dataSource = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<NpgsqlDataSource>();\n",
    "using var connection = await dataSource.OpenConnectionAsync();\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create Products table (if not exists) - already there\n",
    "await connection.ExecuteAsync(@\"\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Products (\n",
    "        Id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        Name TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
    "        Price DECIMAL NOT NULL\n",
    "    )\");\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create Orders and OrderItems tables\n",
    "await connection.ExecuteAsync(@\"\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Orders (\n",
    "        Id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        CustomerName TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
    "        OrderDate TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,\n",
    "        TotalAmount DECIMAL NOT NULL\n",
    "    )\");\n",
    "\n",
    "await connection.ExecuteAsync(@\"\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS OrderItems (\n",
    "        Id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        OrderId INTEGER REFERENCES Orders(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n",
    "        ProductId INTEGER NOT NULL,\n",
    "        Quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,\n",
    "        UnitPrice DECIMAL NOT NULL\n",
    "    )\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.5.2 Create the Order Endpoint in the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a new endpoint to create an order. We\u2019ll also need a DTO for the request:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// ApiService/OrderDto.cs\n",
    "public record CreateOrderRequest(\n",
    "    string CustomerName,\n",
    "    List<OrderItemDto> Items\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "public record OrderItemDto(\n",
    "    int ProductId,\n",
    "    int Quantity\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in `Program.cs`, add the endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.MapPost(\"/orders\", async (CreateOrderRequest request, NpgsqlDataSource dataSource, IConnection connection) =>\n",

    "If you stop the worker service (in the dashboard, you can stop the resource), and then publish an order, the message will remain in the queue. When you restart the worker, it will process the pending message. This demonstrates resilience.\n",

    "### 6.6 Advanced Messaging with Azure Service Bus\n",
    "\n",
    "While RabbitMQ is great for on\u2011premises or containerized environments, many cloud\u2011native applications use Azure Service Bus. Aspire provides components for Service Bus as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.6.1 Adding Azure Service Bus to the AppHost\n",
    "\n",
    "First, add the hosting package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd MyAspireApp.AppHost\n",
    "dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ServiceBus\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can add a Service Bus resource. For local development, you can use the emulator (which runs in a container) or connect to a real Azure Service Bus namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus(\"servicebus\")\n",
    "    .RunAsEmulator();  // Runs the Service Bus emulator container\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if you want to use a real Azure namespace:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus(\"servicebus\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then reference it from your services:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "apiService.WithReference(serviceBus);\n",
    "workerService.WithReference(serviceBus);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection string will be injected as `ConnectionStrings__servicebus`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.6.2 Using the Service Bus Component\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the client component to your projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Program.cs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient(\"servicebus\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This registers `ServiceBusClient` in DI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can publish messages to a queue or topic. For example, in the API:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.MapPost(\"/orders\", async (CreateOrderRequest request, NpgsqlDataSource dataSource, ServiceBusClient serviceBusClient) =>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // ... save order to database ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    var sender = serviceBusClient.CreateSender(\"orders\");\n",
    "    var message = new ServiceBusMessage(JsonSerializer.Serialize(orderEvent))\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        ContentType = \"application/json\",\n",
    "        MessageId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString()\n",
    "    };\n",
    "    await sender.SendMessageAsync(message);\n",
    "\n",
    "    return Results.Ok(new { OrderId = orderId });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And in the worker, you\u2019d use `ServiceBusProcessor` to receive messages. The component automatically enables health checks, tracing, and metrics for Service Bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.7 Messaging Patterns in Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.7.1 Competing Consumers\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, when you have multiple instances of a consumer service, they all listen to the same queue. RabbitMQ (and Service Bus) will deliver each message to only one consumer. This is the **competing consumers** pattern, which allows you to scale out processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run multiple instances of the worker (in the AppHost, you can set replicas), you\u2019ll see messages distributed among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.7.2 Publish/Subscribe with Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want multiple independent consumers to each receive a copy of a message (e.g., an \u201corder placed\u201d event might go to an analytics service and a notification service). This is publish/subscribe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RabbitMQ, you use a **topic exchange** and bind each consumer\u2019s queue with the same routing key. Each consumer gets its own queue, and the exchange copies the message to all bound queues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we used a topic exchange and a single queue. To achieve pub/sub, you\u2019d create a separate queue for each consumer and bind them with the same routing key. The worker would then declare its own queue (perhaps with a unique name) and bind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.7.3 Dead\u2011Letter Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "Messages that cannot be processed (e.g., after multiple retries) should be moved to a **dead\u2011letter queue** for later inspection. RabbitMQ and Service Bus both support this. You can configure the component to handle retries and eventually dead\u2011letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.8 Observability and Health Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great benefits of Aspire components is that they automatically add telemetry. For RabbitMQ, you\u2019ll see:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traces** for publish and consume operations (with RabbitMQ-specific attributes).\n",
    "- **Metrics** like the number of messages published, consumed, and queue sizes (if you enable the RabbitMQ management plugin and the component\u2019s metrics).\n",
    "- **Health checks**: The component adds a health check that verifies connectivity to RabbitMQ. This will appear in the `/health` endpoint and in the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly for Azure Service Bus, you get traces and metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.9 Hands\u2011on: Extend with a Second Consumer\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\u2019s add another worker service that listens for the same `OrderCreated` events but does something different\u2014for example, sends a confirmation email. This will demonstrate the publish/subscribe pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create a new worker project\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet new worker -n MyAspireApp.EmailWorker\n",
    "dotnet sln add MyAspireApp.EmailWorker\n",
    "cd MyAspireApp.EmailWorker\n",
    "dotnet add reference ../MyAspireApp.ServiceDefaults\n",
    "dotnet add package Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Add the project to AppHost\n",
    "\n",
    "In AppHost `Program.cs`, add:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var emailWorker = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyAspireApp_EmailWorker>(\"emailworker\")\n",
    "    .WithReference(messaging);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Implement the email worker\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the `OrderConsumer` code but change the logging to simulate sending an email. Also, give it a unique queue name so it gets its own copy of messages. In the `ExecuteAsync` method, declare a queue with a different name, but bind it with the same routing key.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "await _channel.QueueDeclareAsync(\"email-notification-queue\", durable: true, exclusive: false, autoDelete: false);\n",
    "await _channel.QueueBindAsync(\"email-notification-queue\", \"order-exchange\", \"order.created\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you publish an order, both workers will receive the message (each from its own queue). Check the logs to see both processing the same order ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Observe\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dashboard, you\u2019ll see both workers consuming. In RabbitMQ management, you\u2019ll see two queues, each with one message (which gets consumed). This is pub/sub in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.10 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you\u2019ve learned how to build event\u2011driven systems with .NET Aspire. Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Messaging decouples services and improves resilience.\n",
    "- Aspire provides hosting packages to add RabbitMQ and Azure Service Bus to the AppHost.\n",
    "- The client components automatically register clients, health checks, and telemetry.\n",
    "- You implemented a complete order processing workflow with a publisher (API) and a consumer (worker).\n",
    "- You explored the competing consumers and publish/subscribe patterns.\n",
    "- You saw how to extend with additional consumers and how to use the Azure Service Bus component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Messaging is a fundamental pattern in cloud\u2011native applications. With Aspire, integrating a message broker becomes almost trivial, allowing you to focus on business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we\u2019ll dive into **Externalizing Configuration with Aspire**. You\u2019ll learn how to use Azure App Configuration and Key Vault to manage configuration and secrets across environments, and how to set them up in the AppHost.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the worker to simulate a transient failure (throw an exception randomly). Observe how the message is nacked and requeued, and how many retries happen before it possibly gets stuck.\n",
    "2. Add a dead\u2011letter queue configuration to RabbitMQ. After three failed attempts, move the message to a DLQ.\n",
    "3. Replace RabbitMQ with Azure Service Bus (using the emulator) and adapt the code to use `ServiceBusProcessor`. Compare the complexity.\n",
    "4. Scale the worker to two replicas in the AppHost (use `.WithReplicas(2)`) and observe how messages are load\u2011balanced."
