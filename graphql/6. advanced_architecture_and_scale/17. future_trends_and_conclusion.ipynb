    "### **Understanding @defer**\n",
    "\n",
    "`@defer` allows you to mark fragments of a query as \"low priority.\" The server returns the critical data immediately, then streams the deferred data when ready.\n",

    "**Use Case:** A product page where basic info (name, price) loads immediately, but reviews (slower to fetch) stream in after.\n",

    "**3. Minimize Dependencies:**\n",

    "// Use @apollo/server with specific integrations\n",
    "// Avoid importing entire SDKs (e.g., use AWS SDK v3 modular imports)\n",

    "- **Production Engineering:** Performance optimization, security hardening, monitoring, and testing\n",
    "- **Enterprise Scale:** Federation, schema governance, and distributed systems patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL is more than a technology\u2014it is a paradigm shift in how we think about data APIs. By embracing the graph model, you enable frontend teams to move faster, backend teams to evolve services independently, and organizations to scale their data platforms with confidence.\n",
