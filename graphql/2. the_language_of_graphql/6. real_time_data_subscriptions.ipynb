    "## Chapter 6: Real-Time Data - Subscriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have covered **Queries** (fetching data) and **Mutations** (modifying data). These operate on a \"Request-Response\" cycle: the client asks, and the server answers once. But modern applications often require real-time updates—think of chat apps, stock tickers, or live notifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL solves this with **Subscriptions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 What are Subscriptions? WebSocket Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "A Subscription is a long-lived request where the server pushes data to the client whenever a specific event occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pull vs. Push:**\n",
    "*   **Queries (Pull):** \"Give me the current list of messages.\"\n",
    "*   **Subscriptions (Push):** \"Tell me whenever a new message arrives.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Transport Layer:**\n",
    "While Queries and Mutations typically use standard HTTP, Subscriptions usually run over **WebSockets**. A WebSocket connection stays open, allowing the server to send messages to the client at any time without the client having to request them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Lifecycle:**\n",
    "1.  **Handshake:** Client initiates a WebSocket connection with the server.\n",
    "2.  **Subscription:** Client sends a subscription query over the socket.\n",
    "3.  **Wait:** The connection stays open.\n",
    "4.  **Push:** When an event happens on the server (e.g., a new row in the database), the server executes the subscription query and pushes the result through the open socket.\n",
    "5.  **Unsubscribe:** The client sends a message to stop listening, or closes the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Defining Subscription Schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "Subscriptions are defined in the root `Subscription` type, similar to how Queries and Mutations are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Snippet:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```graphql\n",
    "type Subscription {\n",
    "  \"Subscribe to new messages in a specific chat room\"\n",
    "  messageSent(roomId: ID!): Message!\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \"Subscribe to stock price changes\"\n",
    "  stockPriceUpdated(symbol: String!): Stock!\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "type Message {\n",
    "  id: ID!\n",
    "  text: String!\n",
    "  author: User!\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "type Stock {\n",
    "  symbol: String!\n",
    "  price: Float!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Here, `messageSent` is a subscription field. It takes an argument (`roomId`) and returns a `Message` type. Unlike a query, this doesn't fetch the history; it waits for future events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Subscription Arguments and Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world scenario, you rarely want to broadcast *every* event to *every* client. If I am in \"Room A\", I don't want to receive messages from \"Room B\".\n",
    "\n",
    "While the schema looks simple, the logic happens in the **Resolver** or the **Subscription Manager**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Resolver Logic (Server-Side):**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a client subscribes, the server needs to know if a subsequent event is relevant to that client.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Pseudo-code for subscription resolver (e.g., using Apollo Server)\n",
    "const resolvers = {\n",
    "  Subscription: {\n",
    "    messageSent: {\n",
    "      // The \"subscribe\" method returns an AsyncIterator\n",
    "      subscribe: (parent, { roomId }, { pubsub }) => {\n",
    "        // We channel events specifically for this roomId\n",
    "        return pubsub.asyncIterator([`MESSAGE_SENT_${roomId}`]);\n",
    "      },\n",
    "    },\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Mutation: {\n",
    "    sendMessage: (parent, { roomId, text }, { pubsub }) => {\n",
    "      const newMessage = createMessage(text);\n",
    "      \n",
    "      // We publish the event to the specific channel\n",
    "      pubsub.publish(`MESSAGE_SENT_${roomId}`, { messageSent: newMessage });\n",
    "      \n",
    "      return newMessage;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "1.  **PubSub System:** Servers use a Publish-Subscribe (PubSub) system.\n",
    "2.  **Dynamic Channels:** The resolver creates a dynamic channel name based on the argument (`MESSAGE_SENT_123`).\n",
    "3.  **Filtering:** Only clients subscribed to `MESSAGE_SENT_123` receive the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client-Side Query:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```graphql\n",
    "subscription ListenToRoom {\n",
    "  messageSent(roomId: \"123\") {\n",
    "    text\n",
    "    author {\n",
    "      name\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Argument-based Filtering vs. Resolver Filtering:**\n",
    "*   **Argument-based:** The schema forces the client to specify what they want (e.g., `roomId: ID!`). This is clean and explicit.\n",
    "*   **Resolver Filtering:** For more complex logic (e.g., \"Only notify me if the message mentions me\"), you might use a `filter` function in the resolver logic to check the payload before sending it to the specific client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4 Client-Side Subscription Management (Connection Lifecycle)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the client side, managing a WebSocket connection requires handling connection state, reconnection logic, and subscription lifecycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Apollo Client (React Example):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Apollo Client provides a `useSubscription` hook that handles the complexities of re-subscribing if the network drops.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import { useSubscription, gql } from '@apollo/client';\n",
    "\n",
    "// Define the subscription\n",
    "const MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION = gql`\n",
    "  subscription OnMessageSent($roomId: ID!) {\n",
    "    messageSent(roomId: $roomId) {\n",
    "      text\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "`;\n",
    "\n",
    "function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n",
    "  // Hook automatically manages the connection\n",
    "  const { data, loading } = useSubscription(\n",
    "    MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION, \n",
    "    { variables: { roomId } }\n",
    "  );\n",
    "\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <h4>New Message:</h4>\n",
    "      {loading ? <p>Waiting for messages...</p> : (\n",
    "        <p>{data.messageSent.text}</p>\n",
    "      )}\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Behaviors:**\n",
    "1.  **Mount:** When the component mounts, the hook opens the subscription.\n",
    "2.  **Update:** When the server pushes data, the `data` variable updates, triggering a re-render.\n",
    "3.  **Unmount:** When the component unmounts, the hook automatically unsubscribes, saving server resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Connection Drops:**\n",
    "In production, WebSockets can disconnect (bad network). Robust GraphQL clients use a `WebSocketLink` with retry logic. When the connection is restored, the client typically re-sends all active subscriptions to ensure no events were missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Up: Chapter 7 - Building a GraphQL Server\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:** We have learned the entire language of GraphQL: Queries, Mutations, and Subscriptions. Now it is time to build the engine that powers them. In Chapter 7, we will dive into server-side implementation. We will set up a Node.js server, learn the anatomy of a Resolver, connect to databases, and structure our project for scalability. This chapter moves us from theory to practical application."
