    "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secure your GraphQL schema by disabling introspection in production environments\n",
    "- Implement query depth limiting to prevent nested query attacks\n",
    "- Configure query complexity analysis to prevent Denial of Service (DoS)\n",
    "- Set up rate limiting for GraphQL operations\n",
    "- Implement Persisted Queries (Trusted Documents) to prevent arbitrary query execution\n",
    "- Protect against SQL Injection and XSS in resolvers\n",
    "- Understand the security implications of file uploads in GraphQL\n",
    "- Audit and secure your GraphQL API against common attack vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Prerequisites**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completed Chapter 7: Building a GraphQL Server\n",
    "- Completed Chapter 9: Authentication and Authorization\n",
    "- Understanding of common web security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)\n",

    "## **12.1 Understanding the Attack Surface**\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL APIs have a unique attack surface compared to REST APIs. While REST endpoints are fixed and predictable, GraphQL allows clients to construct arbitrary queries. This flexibility creates specific vulnerabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introspection Discovery**: Attackers can discover your entire schema structure\n",
    "2. **Deep Recursion**: Nested queries can cause stack overflows or database timeouts\n",
    "3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Expensive queries can crash your server (DoS)\n",
    "4. **Injection Attacks**: Malicious input in variables can leak data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will address each of these systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **12.2 Introspection: Disabling in Production**\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL Introspection is the ability to query the schema itself (using `__schema`, `__type`, etc.). Tools like GraphiQL and Apollo Studio rely on this for auto-completion and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Risk:** In production, introspection allows attackers to discover your entire API structure, field names, relationships, and deprecated fields. This is reconnaissance gold for attackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apollo Server Configuration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');\n",
    "\n",
    "const server = new ApolloServer({\n",
    "  typeDefs,\n",
    "  resolvers,\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Disable introspection in production\n",
    "  introspection: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Also disable the playground in production\n",
    "  playground: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative: Using Validation Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need more granular control (e.g., allowing introspection only for authenticated admins):\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const { NoIntrospection } = require('graphql-disable-introspection');\n",
    "\n",
    "const server = new ApolloServer({\n",
    "  typeDefs,\n",
    "  resolvers,\n",
    "  validationRules: [\n",
    "    // Conditionally disable introspection\n",
    "    (context) => {\n",
    "      if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && !context.user?.isAdmin) {\n",
    "        return new NoIntrospection();\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      return null;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:** Always disable introspection in production unless you have a specific use case (like a public API with open documentation). If you must keep it enabled, restrict it to authenticated users with admin privileges.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Persisted Queries** (also called **Trusted Documents** or **Allow Lists**) solve a critical security issue: arbitrary query execution.\n",

    "1.  **Development**: Client extracts all GraphQL queries from the codebase.\n",
    "2.  **Build**: Client generates unique hashes (SHA-256) for each query.\n",
    "3.  **Registration**: Client sends the full query strings to the server, which stores them in a database (query ID → query string).\n",
    "4.  **Production**: Client only sends the hash (ID), not the full query string.\n",
    "5.  **Execution**: Server looks up the query by hash, rejects unknown hashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "*   **Security**: Attackers cannot execute arbitrary queries—only pre-approved ones.\n",
    "*   **Performance**: Reduced payload size (sending hash instead of full query).\n",

    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Security is not a feature; it is a continuous process. This chapter covered the essential defenses for production GraphQL APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Introspection**: Disable in production to prevent schema discovery, or restrict to authenticated admins.\n",
    "2.  **Depth Limiting**: Prevent deep recursion attacks using `graphql-depth-limit`.\n",
    "3.  **Complexity Analysis**: Calculate and limit query cost to prevent resource exhaustion (DoS).\n",
    "4.  **Rate Limiting**: Restrict request frequency by user/IP to prevent brute force and abuse.\n",
    "5.  **Persisted Queries**: Use Trusted Documents (Allow Lists) in production to prevent arbitrary query execution. Only pre-approved queries are executable.\n",
    "6.  **Injection Prevention**: Always use parameterized queries for SQL and sanitize HTML to prevent XSS.\n",
    "7.  **File Uploads**: Validate MIME types, extensions, sanitize filenames, limit size, and scan for malware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Security Checklist for Production:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Introspection disabled or restricted\n",
    "- [ ] Query depth limited (e.g., max 10)\n",
    "- [ ] Query complexity limited (e.g., max 1000)\n",
    "- [ ] Rate limiting implemented (Redis-backed)\n",
    "- [ ] Persisted Queries enabled (strict mode)\n",
    "- [ ] SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries)\n",
    "- [ ] XSS prevented (input sanitization)\n",
    "- [ ] File uploads validated and sanitized\n",
    "- [ ] HTTPS enforced\n",
    "- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info\n",

    "### **🚀 Next Up: Chapter 13 - Monitoring and Observability**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:** A secure and performant system is only useful if you can see what's happening inside it. In Chapter 13, we will explore monitoring and observability. You will learn how to implement structured logging, trace resolver execution times, integrate with Apollo Studio for schema monitoring, and set up alerts for when things go wrong."
