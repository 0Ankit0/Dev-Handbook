    "## **32.7 Common Pitfalls**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chasing Every Trend:** Implementing every new architecture without depth. **Fix:** Deep dive into one trend per quarter (e.g., spend 3 months really understanding SSMs) rather than surface knowledge of ten.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Research vs. Engineering Imbalance:** Reading papers but not coding, or coding without understanding theory. **Fix:** 50/50 split—implement what you read.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hardware Neglect:** Ignoring inference costs until deployment. **Fix:** Always measure FLOPs, memory, and latency during prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hype Cycle Trap:** Assuming bigger is always better. **Fix:** Evaluate efficiency (performance per parameter, per joule, per dollar).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Isolation:** Not engaging with the community. **Fix:** Open source your implementations, ask questions on GitHub issues, attend meetups.\n",

    "## **32.8 Interview Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1:** What emerging architecture do you think has the best chance of replacing Transformers, and why?\n",
    "*A: \"State Space Models (Mamba) show the most promise for long-sequence modeling due to linear complexity. However, they currently lag on certain reasoning tasks that require global context. For multimodal data, I believe hybrid architectures will prevail—SSMs for local sequence modeling with sparse attention for global cross-modal connections. The key metric isn't just perplexity but training stability at scale and hardware utilization (SSMs are memory-bound not compute-bound, which is easier to optimize).\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2:** How do you evaluate whether a new research paper is worth implementing in production?\n",
    "*A: \"Checklist: (1) Code availability—if authors didn't release code, implementation risk is high, (2) Computational requirements—does it fit our inference budget? (3) Ablation studies—does the main contribution clearly cause the gain, or is it just scale? (4) Robustness—tested on multiple datasets or just one? (5) Maintenance burden—is this a simple drop-in replacement or a complex new system? I typically wait 6 months after publication for community validation unless it's critical to our roadmap.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3:** Explain the trade-offs between 4-bit quantization and full precision for LLMs.\n",
    "*A: \"4-bit (INT4/FP4) reduces model size 4x and memory bandwidth 4x, enabling larger models on single GPUs. However: (1) Quantization-aware training helps but post-training quantization (GPTQ/AWQ) can cause perplexity degradation, especially for smaller models (<7B), (2) Activation outliers in LLMs hurt INT4—solutions like LLM.int8() keep some weights in FP16 or use block-wise quantization, (3) For tasks requiring precise numbers (arithmetic, code), 4-bit may fail where 8-bit succeeds. I recommend 4-bit for consumer deployment, 8-bit for enterprise APIs requiring reliability.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4:** What is neuromorphic computing's role in the future of AI hardware?\n",
    "*A: \"Neuromorphic chips (Loihi, SpiNNaker) excel at sparse, event-based computation with milliwatt power envelopes—ideal for always-on edge devices (hearing aids, implantable medical devices, sensor networks). However, they lag on dense matrix multiplication where GPUs dominate. I see them as complementary: neuromorphic for preprocessing/filtering at the edge, GPUs for heavy lifting in the cloud. The killer app is robotics with event cameras + SNNs for microsecond-latency obstacle avoidance.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5:** How do you stay current without burning out?\n",
    "*A: \"Systematic filtering: I batch process arXiv weekly rather than daily, use Twitter lists to curate signal-to-noise, and focus on implementation over passive reading. I dedicate Friday afternoons to 'research time'—reading one paper deeply or implementing a method. I ignore 'me-too' papers (slight variations on known methods) unless they beat SOTA by >5%. Community engagement helps—discussing papers with peers at meetups often reveals which techniques actually work in practice vs. which are just benchmark hacking.\"*\n",
