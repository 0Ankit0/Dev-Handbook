    "**Q1:** \"Explain gradient descent to a non-technical stakeholder.\"\n",
    "*A: \"Imagine you're hiking in fog and want to reach the valley bottom. You feel the slope under your feet (gradient) and take a step downhill (update). The step size (learning rate) matters: too big and you overshoot, too small and it takes forever. Momentum is like adding a ball that rolls downhill, gaining speed in consistent directions. We use this to minimize the 'lost' or error of our predictions by adjusting millions of knobs (parameters) simultaneously.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2:** \"How would you debug a model that performs well offline but poorly online?\"\n",
    "*A: \"Checklist: (1) Data leakage in offline evaluation (future features in training), (2) Training-serving skew (different preprocessing), (3) Distribution shift (concept drift since training), (4) Latency forcing approximations online not used offline, (5) Feedback loops (model changes user behavior, making past labels invalid). I'd start by logging production predictions and features, then running offline evaluation on production data to isolate if it's a data issue or serving issue.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3:** \"Design a model to predict click-through rate for ads.\"\n",
    "*A: \"Architecture: Wide-and-Deep network. Wide part: Memorization of feature crosses (user_id \u00d7 ad_id) for sparse patterns. Deep part: Generalization via embeddings for categorical features (user demographics, ad creative) fed through hidden layers. Features: User historical CTR, ad relevance score, position bias (top slots get more clicks regardless of quality), time of day. Training: Log loss on historical clicks, handle class imbalance via downsampling or weighted loss. Serving: Latency constraint <10ms requires feature caching and lightweight model (maybe distill to two-layer network after training deep).\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4:** \"Tell me about a time you had to make a significant architectural decision without complete information.\"\n",
    "*A: \"(STAR) Situation: We needed to choose between batch and real-time processing for fraud detection with 1-week deadline. Task: Decide architecture to handle Black Friday traffic. Action: Built decision matrix (cost vs latency), prototyped both with 10% data, conducted load tests. Chose hybrid: real-time for high-value transactions ($>1000), batch for smaller. Built abstraction layer to allow migration later. Result: Handled 5x traffic spike, 99.9% detection rate. Post-Black Friday, migrated fully to real-time once proven.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5:** \"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\"\n",
    "*A: (For MLE role): \"Deepening technical expertise in efficient model serving and potentially leading a small infrastructure team. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of ML systems and hardware optimization\u2014how to maximize utilization of H100 clusters. Long-term, I want to architect systems that enable researchers to train models 10x larger than today without 10x the engineering overhead.\"*\n",
