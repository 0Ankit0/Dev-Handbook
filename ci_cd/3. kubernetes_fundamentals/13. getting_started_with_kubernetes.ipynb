    "# Chapter 13: Getting Started with Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Having established the architectural foundations of Kubernetes in Chapter 12, we now transition from theoretical understanding to practical implementation. Before deploying production workloads, you need a local development environment that accurately mirrors production behavior while remaining lightweight enough for iterative development. This chapter guides you through installing local Kubernetes clusters, configuring the kubectl command-line interface, and executing your first deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you are developing on macOS, Windows, or Linux, modern tooling provides Kubernetes clusters that run directly on your workstation with minimal resource overhead. We will explore the trade-offs between Minikube, Kind, and k3d to help you select the appropriate tool for your specific development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13.1 Local Kubernetes Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Kubernetes clusters serve multiple purposes: learning the platform, developing applications against realistic APIs, and testing configurations before production deployment. Unlike production clusters with dedicated control plane nodes, local solutions package everything into a single executable or container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Minikube\n",
    "\n",
    "Minikube is the original local Kubernetes implementation and remains the most widely supported option. It creates a single-node cluster inside a virtual machine (VM) or container, supporting multiple virtualization backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:**\n",
    "Minikube provisions a VM (using Hyper-V, VirtualBox, VMware, or KVM) or Docker container containing:\n",
    "- Single-node Kubernetes cluster (control plane and worker combined)\n",
    "- Container runtime (containerd, CRI-O, or Docker)\n",
    "- Default storage class and networking plugins\n",
    "- Addon manager for optional components (Ingress, Dashboard, Registry)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "macOS (using Homebrew):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install minikube\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows (using Chocolatey):\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "choco install minikube\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64\n",
    "sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Starting the Cluster:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Start with default settings (Docker driver on Linux/macOS, Hyper-V on Windows)\n",
    "minikube start\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start with specific Kubernetes version matching production\n",
    "minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.28.3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start with increased resources for resource-intensive applications\n",
    "minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=8192 --disk-size=50g\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start with specific container runtime\n",
    "minikube start --container-runtime=containerd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start with CNI plugin for network policy testing\n",
    "minikube start --cni=calico\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Commands:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check cluster status\n",
    "minikube status\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open Kubernetes Dashboard (built-in)\n",
    "minikube dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access cluster services via tunnel\n",
    "minikube service my-service\n",
    "\n",
    "# SSH into the node for debugging\n",
    "minikube ssh\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pause cluster without deleting (preserve state)\n",
    "minikube pause\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stop cluster\n",
    "minikube stop\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete cluster and clean up\n",
    "minikube delete\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add-ons:**\n",
    "Minikube provides pre-configured add-ons for common requirements:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Enable Ingress controller (NGINX)\n",
    "minikube addons enable ingress\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enable local registry\n",
    "minikube addons enable registry\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enable metrics-server for kubectl top\n",
    "minikube addons enable metrics-server\n",
    "\n",
    "# List available addons\n",
    "minikube addons list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Minikube:**\n",
    "- You need a VM-isolated environment separate from your Docker installation\n",
    "- You require specific Kubernetes versions for compatibility testing\n",
    "- You need persistent volumes that survive cluster restarts\n",
    "- You are learning Kubernetes and want the most documented solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Kind (Kubernetes IN Docker)\n",
    "\n",
    "Kind runs Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers as nodes. Unlike Minikube's VM approach, Kind creates \"node\" containers that run systemd and Kubernetes components, making it significantly faster to start and more resource-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:**\n",
    "- Control plane and worker nodes are Docker containers\n",
    "- Uses kubeadm for cluster provisioning (production-like setup)\n",
    "- Supports multi-node clusters (including HA configurations) on a single machine\n",
    "- Ideal for CI/CD pipelines due to speed and Docker-native approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# macOS/Linux\n",
    "curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.20.0/kind-$(uname)-amd64\n",
    "chmod +x ./kind\n",
    "sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or via Homebrew\n",
    "brew install kind\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating Clusters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create default single-node cluster\n",
    "kind create cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create named cluster (allows multiple clusters)\n",
    "kind create cluster --name dev-cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create multi-node cluster for testing pod distribution\n",
    "cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --config=-\n",
    "kind: Cluster\n",
    "apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4\n",
    "nodes:\n",
    "- role: control-plane\n",
    "- role: worker\n",
    "- role: worker\n",
    "- role: worker\n",
    "EOF\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create cluster with specific Kubernetes version\n",
    "kind create cluster --image kindest/node:v1.28.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create cluster with port mappings for local development\n",
    "cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --config=-\n",
    "kind: Cluster\n",
    "apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4\n",
    "nodes:\n",
    "- role: control-plane\n",
    "  extraPortMappings:\n",
    "  - containerPort: 80\n",
    "    hostPort: 8080\n",
    "    listenAddress: \"0.0.0.0\"\n",
    "    protocol: TCP\n",
    "  - containerPort: 443\n",
    "    hostPort: 8443\n",
    "    listenAddress: \"0.0.0.0\"\n",
    "    protocol: TCP\n",
    "EOF\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loading Images:**\n",
    "A key advantage of Kind is loading local images without registries:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Build image locally\n",
    "docker build -t my-app:latest .\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load into Kind cluster\n",
    "kind load docker-image my-app:latest --name dev-cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or load from archive\n",
    "kind load image-archive my-app.tar --name dev-cluster\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Commands:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# List clusters\n",
    "kind get clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete cluster\n",
    "kind delete cluster --name dev-cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "# Export kubeconfig for specific cluster\n",
    "kind export kubeconfig --name dev-cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get cluster information\n",
    "kubectl cluster-info --context kind-dev-cluster\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Kind:**\n",
    "- You need multi-node clusters for testing scheduling, affinity, or distributed systems\n",
    "- You are running CI/CD pipelines (fast startup, easy cleanup)\n",
    "- You want to test Kubernetes itself or controllers\n",
    "- You prefer Docker-native workflows without VM overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3: k3d (K3s in Docker)\n",
    "\n",
    "k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher's minimal Kubernetes distribution) in Docker. K3s is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution designed for resource-constrained environments, stripping out legacy features and using SQLite instead of etcd (by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:**\n",
    "- Single binary Kubernetes (control plane and kubelet combined)\n",
    "- Uses SQLite for storage instead of etcd (lighter weight)\n",
    "- Ships with Traefik ingress controller and local-path-provisioner by default\n",
    "- Extremely fast startup (seconds vs. minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# macOS (Homebrew)\n",
    "brew install k3d\n",

    "\n",
    "# Use in deployment\n",
    "# image: k3d-myregistry:5000/myapp:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Commands:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# List clusters\n",
    "k3d cluster list\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start/Stop cluster (preserve state)\n",
    "k3d cluster stop mycluster\n",
    "k3d cluster start mycluster\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# List nodes\n",
    "k3d node list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use k3d:**\n",
    "- You need the fastest possible startup time\n",
    "- You are developing on resource-constrained machines (laptops with limited RAM)\n",
    "- You want built-in Ingress and registry support without manual addon installation\n",
    "- You prefer the simplicity of k3s architecture\n",
    "\n",

    "- Virtual node option using Azure Container Instances\n",
    "- GitOps integration with Flux\n",
    "- Azure Policy enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection Criteria:**\n",
    "- **Ecosystem proximity**: Choose the cloud where your data resides\n",
    "- **Pricing model**: Control plane fees ($0.10/hour for EKS/AKS, GKE free tier available)\n",
    "- **Integration needs**: IAM, networking, and storage integration requirements\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Specific certifications required (FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI DSS)\n",
    "\n",
    "For initial learning, start with local clusters; migrate to cloud-managed solutions when moving toward production or requiring persistent infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 13.6 Understanding Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. They are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams or projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Namespace Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope of Names:**\n",
    "Resource names need only be unique within a namespace. You can have a Pod named \"web\" in namespace \"development\" and another Pod named \"web\" in namespace \"production\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default Namespaces:**\n",
    "Kubernetes starts with four initial namespaces:\n",
    "- **default**: For resources without a specified namespace\n",
    "- **kube-system**: For Kubernetes system components (control plane, addons)\n",
    "- **kube-public**: For publicly accessible data (configmaps with cluster info)\n",
    "- **kube-node-lease**: For node heartbeat leases (lightweight availability detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating Namespaces:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# namespace-dev.yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: v1\n",
    "kind: Namespace\n",
    "metadata:\n",
    "  name: development\n",
    "  labels:\n",
    "    environment: dev\n",
    "    cost-center: engineering\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kubectl apply -f namespace-dev.yaml\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or imperatively\n",
    "kubectl create namespace production\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Namespace Operations:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# List namespaces\n",
    "kubectl get namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "# List resources in specific namespace\n",
    "kubectl get pods -n development\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set default namespace for current context\n",
    "kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=development\n",
    "\n",
    "# View resources across all namespaces\n",
    "kubectl get pods --all-namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete namespace (deletes all contained resources)\n",
    "kubectl delete namespace development\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Namespace Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment Separation:**\n",
    "Rather than maintaining separate clusters for dev/staging/prod (expensive), use namespaces with resource quotas:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: v1\n",
    "kind: ResourceQuota\n",
    "metadata:\n",
    "  name: dev-quota\n",
    "  namespace: development\n",
    "spec:\n",
    "  hard:\n",
    "    requests.cpu: \"10\"\n",
    "    requests.memory: 20Gi\n",
    "    limits.cpu: \"20\"\n",
    "    limits.memory: 40Gi\n",
    "    pods: \"50\"\n",
    "    services: \"20\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team Isolation:**\n",
    "Different teams own different namespaces with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricting access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blue/Green Deployments:**\n",
    "Deploy new versions in separate namespaces for instant switching:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kubectl apply -f app-v2.yaml -n blue\n",
    "# Test, then switch service selector or ingress to blue namespace\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Networking and Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Namespaces provide DNS isolation. Services in different namespaces reference each other using fully qualified domain names (FQDN):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# From a pod in namespace 'development'\n",
    "curl http://backend-service          # Same namespace\n",
    "curl http://backend-service.production.svc.cluster.local  # Different namespace\n",
    "# Format: <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13.7 Context and Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work with multiple clusters (local development, staging, production), kubectl contexts enable rapid switching without manual reconfiguration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Management Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Setup:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Development (Minikube)\n",
    "kubectl config set-cluster dev-cluster --server=https://192.168.49.2:8443 --certificate-authority=/path/to/ca.crt\n",
    "kubectl config set-credentials dev-user --client-certificate=/path/to/dev.crt --client-key=/path/to/dev.key\n",
    "kubectl config set-context dev --cluster=dev-cluster --user=dev-user --namespace=default\n",
    "\n",
    "# Production (EKS)\n",
    "aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-west-2 --name prod-cluster\n",
    "# This automatically adds context named arn:aws:eks:region:account:cluster/prod-cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "# Switch between them\n",
    "kubectl config use-context dev\n",
    "kubectl config use-context arn:aws:eks:region:account:cluster/prod-cluster\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Indicators:**\n",
    "Consider adding current context to your shell prompt to prevent accidental production changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc\n",
    "source <(kubectl completion bash)\n",
    "alias k=kubectl\n",
    "complete -o default -F __start_kubectl k\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show current context in prompt (using kube-ps1)\n",
    "source /usr/local/opt/kube-ps1/share/kube-ps1.sh\n",
    "PS1='$(kube_ps1)'$PS1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Protection:**\n",
    "Add visual warnings for production contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# ~/.bashrc\n",
    "function kubectl() {\n",
    "    local context=$(kubectl config current-context 2>/dev/null)\n",
    "    if [[ \"$context\" == *\"prod\"* ]] && [[ \"$1\" == \"delete\" ]]; then\n",
    "        read -p \"⚠️  PRODUCTION DELETE. Are you sure? (type 'yes'): \" confirm\n",
    "        if [[ \"$confirm\" != \"yes\" ]]; then\n",
    "            echo \"Aborted.\"\n",
    "            return 1\n",
    "        fi\n",
    "    fi\n",
    "    command kubectl \"$@\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dry Runs:**\n",
    "Always validate changes before applying:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Client-side dry run (validation only)\n",
    "kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml --dry-run=client\n",
    "\n",
    "# Server-side dry run (validates against API server without persisting)\n",
    "kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml --dry-run=server\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## Chapter Summary and Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we transitioned from Kubernetes architecture theory to practical implementation. You installed and configured local Kubernetes clusters using Minikube (VM-based, feature-rich), Kind (Docker-native, CI/CD optimized), and k3d (ultra-lightweight, fast startup). We configured kubectl for cross-platform usage, explored kubeconfig file structures for multi-cluster management, and established namespace-based isolation patterns. Basic kubectl commands for CRUD operations, debugging, and log analysis provide the foundation for daily operations. Finally, you deployed a complete multi-tier application demonstrating service discovery, configuration management, and scaling workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Local clusters (Minikube, Kind, k3d) provide production-like environments for development without cloud costs.\n",
    "- kubectl uses kubeconfig files to manage cluster connections; contexts enable safe switching between environments.\n",
    "- Namespaces isolate resources within a cluster, enabling environment separation and team boundaries without maintaining multiple clusters.\n",
    "- Always use --dry-run=server before applying changes to production environments.\n",
    "- Resource specifications (requests/limits) ensure applications coexist without resource starvation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Chapter Preview:**\n",
    "Chapter 14: Kubernetes Core Resources delves into the fundamental building blocks of Kubernetes applications. You will master Pods in detail (lifecycle, probes, multi-container patterns), Deployments (rolling updates, rollback strategies, ReplicaSets), Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, Endpoints), ConfigMaps and Secrets (configuration management), and the label/selector system enabling loose coupling. These resources form the vocabulary through which you express application requirements to the Kubernetes control plane introduced in Chapter 12."
