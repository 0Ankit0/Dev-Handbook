    "# Chapter 26: GitHub Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "While Chapter 25 explored Jenkins as a self-hosted, extensible automation platform, this chapter examines GitHub Actions—the cloud-native, event-driven CI/CD service tightly integrated into the GitHub ecosystem. Unlike Jenkins' persistent master-agent architecture, GitHub Actions operates as a serverless compute service that responds to repository events, executing workflows in ephemeral, containerized environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Actions eliminates infrastructure management overhead while providing native integration with pull requests, issues, and GitHub Packages. Understanding its workflow syntax, runner ecosystem, and security model enables teams to implement sophisticated CI/CD pipelines without maintaining build servers, while self-hosted runners offer escape hatches for specialized workloads requiring custom hardware or network access.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 26.1 GitHub Actions Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Actions is built on three foundational abstractions: workflows, jobs, and steps. Understanding these concepts is essential for architecting efficient automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows are automated processes defined in YAML files stored in `.github/workflows/`. Each workflow:\n",
    "- Triggers based on GitHub events (push, pull request, schedule)\n",
    "- Executes one or more jobs\n",
    "- Runs in fresh virtual environments (runners)\n",
    "- Provides execution logs and artifacts in the GitHub UI\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# .github/workflows/ci.yml\n",
    "name: Continuous Integration  # Workflow name displayed in GitHub UI\n",
    "\n",
    "on:  # Trigger configuration\n",
    "  push:\n",
    "    branches: [main, develop]\n",
    "  pull_request:\n",
    "    branches: [main]\n",
    "  schedule:\n",
    "    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday\n",
    "\n",
    "jobs:  # Collection of jobs to execute\n",
    "  build:\n",
    "    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Execution environment\n",
    "    steps:\n",
    "      - uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Prebuilt action\n",
    "      - name: Install dependencies\n",
    "        run: npm ci  # Shell command\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event-Driven Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Jenkins' polling or webhook-triggered jobs, GitHub Actions natively responds to 30+ GitHub events:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "on:\n",
    "  # Code events\n",
    "  push:\n",
    "    branches: ['main', 'release/*']\n",
    "    paths: ['src/**', '!src/docs/**']  # Only when src changes, ignore docs\n",
    "  \n",
    "  pull_request:\n",
    "    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # Issue events (for automation)\n",
    "  issues:\n",
    "    types: [opened, labeled]\n",
    "  \n",

    "    types: [deploy-staging]\n",

    "  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual button in GitHub UI\n",

    "        required: false\n",
    "        type: boolean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Model\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Actions executes workflows with specific constraints:\n",
    "- **Timeouts**: Default 360 minutes (6 hours), configurable down to 1 minute\n",
    "- **Concurrency**: Free tier allows 20 concurrent jobs (Linux), 5 (macOS), 120 (Windows)\n",
    "- **Billing**: Linux runners free for public repos, 2,000 minutes/month for private repos (free tier)\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Each job runs in a fresh VM or container; no persistence between runs except via caching/artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "## 26.2 Workflow Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Actions workflows use YAML with a specific schema defining the execution pipeline.\n",

    "## Chapter Summary and Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we examined GitHub Actions as a cloud-native, event-driven CI/CD platform contrasting with Jenkins' self-hosted architecture. We explored the workflow syntax defining jobs, steps, and triggers, leveraging 30+ GitHub events from push operations to repository dispatches for sophisticated automation. The job execution model enables parallelization through matrices and dependency chains, while service containers facilitate integration testing with real dependencies. Reusable workflows and composite actions provide organization-level standardization without the infrastructure overhead of shared libraries. Docker integration through official actions enables multi-platform builds with GitHub Actions cache or registry-based layer caching, generating SBOMs and provenance attestations for supply chain security. Kubernetes deployment patterns demonstrated OIDC authentication eliminating long-lived credentials, alongside GitOps integration with ArgoCD. Self-hosted runners via Actions Runner Controller offer elastic compute for specialized workloads requiring GPU access or private network connectivity. Security patterns emphasized environment protection rules, required reviewers, and OpenID Connect token authentication for seamless, passwordless cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Leverage GitHub Actions' event-driven nature to trigger workflows not just on code changes but on issues, releases, and repository dispatches, enabling comprehensive DevOps automation beyond traditional CI/CD\n",
    "- Use reusable workflows centralized in dedicated repositories to enforce organizational standards (security scanning, approval gates) across hundreds of microservices without duplicating YAML\n",
    "- Implement OIDC token authentication (aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials, google-github-actions/auth) to eliminate long-lived cloud credentials, using short-lived tokens scoped to specific repository branches and workflows\n",
    "- Prefer GitHub-hosted runners for standard workloads to minimize operational overhead, reserving self-hosted runners for specialized requirements (GPU, private network access, specific licensing) with strict labeling and cleanup procedures\n",
    "- Utilize environment protection rules with required reviewers and deployment branches for production deployments, ensuring manual gates even in automated workflows while maintaining audit trails\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Chapter Preview:**\n",
    "Chapter 27: GitLab CI/CD explores GitLab's integrated DevOps platform, examining its YAML syntax, pipeline visualization, and native Kubernetes integration through GitLab Runners. We will analyze GitLab's unique features including the Merge Train for serializing merges, Auto DevOps for zero-configuration pipelines, and built-in security scanning (SAST/DAST/Dependency Scanning) that operates without external tool integration. This chapter covers GitLab's approach to pipeline as code, artifact management with integrated Container Registry, and deployment strategies using environments and review apps, providing comprehensive coverage of the third major CI/CD platform alongside Jenkins and GitHub Actions."
