    "# Chapter 34: Kubernetes Admission Controllers\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes provides robust mechanisms for controlling what objects can be created and how they are configured within a cluster. While Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) determines **who** can perform operations, Admission Controllers determine **what** can be done and **how** resources should be configured. They act as gatekeepers that intercept requests to the Kubernetes API server after authentication and authorization, but before the object is persisted to etcd.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores the two primary categories of admission controllers\u2014Validating and Mutating\u2014and examines production-ready implementations including Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper. Understanding admission controllers is essential for implementing security policies, enforcing organizational standards, and maintaining cluster hygiene without modifying application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 34.1 ValidatingAdmissionWebhook\n",
    "\n",
    "ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks enforce strict policy compliance by rejecting API requests that violate defined rules. Unlike mutating controllers, they cannot modify objects; they only approve or deny them. This makes them ideal for security policies, compliance checks, and organizational constraints that must be strictly enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Validation Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user or service submits a request to the API server:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Authentication**: Is the requester who they claim to be?\n",
    "2. **Authorization**: Does the requester have permission to perform this action?\n",
    "3. **Mutating Admission**: Can any fields be automatically adjusted?\n",
    "4. **Validating Admission**: Does this object meet policy requirements?\n",
    "5. **Persistence**: Object written to etcd\n",
    "\n",
    "If any ValidatingWebhook rejects the request, the API server returns an HTTP 400-level error with the rejection message, and the object is not created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Webhook Configuration Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A ValidatingWebhookConfiguration defines which resources are validated and where to send the validation request:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1\n",

    "**Key Configuration Fields:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Field | Description | Security Implication |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| `failurePolicy` | `Fail` rejects requests on webhook errors; `Ignore` allows them | Always use `Fail` for security policies to prevent bypass during outages |\n",
    "| `timeoutSeconds` | Maximum wait time for webhook response | Short timeouts prevent API server overload but may cause false rejections |\n",
    "| `namespaceSelector` | Limits webhook to specific namespaces | Useful for exempting system namespaces or gradual policy rollout |\n",
    "| `matchConditions` | CEL expressions for fine-grained filtering (Kubernetes 1.27+) | Reduces webhook load by filtering before sending to backend |\n",

    "if container.image.endswith(\":latest\"):\n",
    "    return deny(\"Using 'latest' tag is prohibited. Use specific semantic versions.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enforcing Resource Limits:**\n",

    "# Ensure all containers have resource limits\n",
    "if not container.resources.limits:\n",
    "    return deny(\"Resource limits must be specified\")\n",

    "    return deny(\"Both memory and CPU limits are required\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restricting HostPath Volumes:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "for volume in pod.spec.volumes:\n",
    "    if volume.hostPath:\n",
    "        return deny(\"HostPath volumes are not permitted\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 34.2 MutatingAdmissionWebhook\n",
    "\n",
    "MutatingAdmissionWebhooks intercept API requests and modify the object before it is persisted. They are powerful tools for applying defaults, injecting sidecars, and ensuring consistent configurations without requiring user intervention. Because they execute before validating webhooks, mutations can prepare objects to pass subsequent validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutation Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sidecar Injection:**\n",
    "Automatically inject monitoring agents, service mesh proxies, or logging containers into Pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default Resource Values:**\n",
    "Apply default resource requests and limits when developers omit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Standardization:**\n",
    "Automatically add labels based on namespace, user, or other contextual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Context Defaults:**\n",
    "Apply security best practices (runAsNonRoot, readOnlyRootFilesystem) if not specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MutatingWebhookConfiguration Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1\n",

    "    sideEffects: None\n",
    "    admissionReviewVersions: [\"v1\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinvocation Policy:**\n",
    "- `Never`: Webhook is called once per operation\n",
    "- `IfNeeded`: Webhook may be called again if subsequent webhooks modify the object (useful for ensuring your mutations persist)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutation Implementation Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The webhook receives the AdmissionReview, modifies the object, and returns a patch:\n",

    "    patches = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Add security context if missing\n",
    "    if 'securityContext' not in pod['spec']:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Idempotency and Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutating webhooks must be **idempotent**\u2014applying the same mutation multiple times should not create duplicate or conflicting changes. This is critical because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The API server may retry failed webhook calls\n",
    "2. Multiple mutating webhooks may process the same object\n",
    "3. Objects may be updated multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:** Check for existing mutations before applying changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if mutation already applied\n",
    "if pod['metadata'].get('annotations', {}).get('mutated-by') == 'my-webhook':\n",
    "    return allow_without_modification()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply mutation\n",
    "# ...\n",
    "# Add annotation to track mutation\n",

    "Rego (pronounced \"ray-go\") is purpose-built for evaluating policies over structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Structure:**\n",
    "```rego\n",
    "package example\n",
    "\n",
    "import future.keywords.if\n",
    "import future.keywords.in\n",
    "\n",
    "# Default deny\n",
    "default allow := false\n",
    "\n",
    "# Allow if user is admin\n",
    "allow if {\n",
    "    input.user.role == \"admin\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Allow if user owns the resource\n",
    "allow if {\n",
    "    input.user.name == input.resource.owner\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deny with message\n",
    "deny[msg] {\n",
    "    not input.user.email\n",
    "    msg := \"User email is required\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Description | Example |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| **Rules** | Define logic that evaluates to true/false or values | `allow if { ... }` |\n",
    "| **Variables** | Local assignments within rules | `name := input.metadata.name` |\n",
    "| **Iteration** | Loop over arrays/objects | `container := input.spec.containers[_]` |\n",
    "| **Sets** | Mathematical set operations | `forbidden := {\"latest\", \"master\"}` |\n",
    "| **Functions** | Reusable logic blocks | `is_valid_tag(tag)` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Effective Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context-Aware Validation:**\n",
    "```rego\n",
    "violation[{\"msg\": msg}] {\n",
    "    # Extract container image\n",
    "    container := input.review.object.spec.containers[_]\n",
    "    image := container.image\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Parse image components\n",
    "    contains(image, \"@sha256:\")  # Check for digest reference\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Extract tag\n",
    "    not startswith(image, \"gcr.io/company-internal/\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    msg := sprintf(\"Container %v uses external image repository\", [container.name])\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Policies:**\n",
    "Rego includes a testing framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rego\n",
    "package k8srequiredlabels\n",
    "\n",
    "test_allowed {\n",

    "## 34.5 Image Policy Admission\n",
    "\n",
    "Container images are a critical attack vector. Image Policy Admission controllers ensure only trusted, scanned, and compliant images run in your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ImagePolicyWebhook (Deprecated)\n",
    "\n",
    "The legacy `ImagePolicyWebhook` requires a separate external service:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml\n",

    "    command:\n",
    "    - kube-apiserver\n",
    "    - --enable-admission-plugins=ImagePolicyWebhook\n",
    "    - --admission-control-config-file=/etc/kubernetes/admission-control.yaml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Requires API server configuration changes\n",
    "- Single point of failure if webhook unavailable\n",

    "## Best Practices and Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defense in Depth**: Use admission controllers as the last line of defense, not the only one. Combine with RBAC, Pod Security Standards, and network policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fail Closed**: Always set `failurePolicy: Fail` for security-critical webhooks to prevent policy bypass during outages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scope Restrictions**: Use `namespaceSelector` and `objectSelector` to avoid processing system components or already-compliant workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Certificate Rotation**: Automate certificate management with cert-manager to prevent expiration-related outages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Audit Logging**: Enable audit logging for admission decisions:\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1\n",
    "   kind: Policy\n",
    "   rules:\n",
    "   - level: RequestResponse\n",
    "     resources:\n",
    "     - group: \"\"\n",
    "       resources: [\"pods\"]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Webhook Latency:**\n",
    "- Keep webhook response times under 1 second\n",
    "- Use in-memory caching for reference data\n",
    "- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Availability:**\n",
    "- Run webhooks with multiple replicas\n",
    "- Use PodDisruptionBudgets to ensure availability during updates\n",
    "- Consider the impact of cluster upgrades on webhook availability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Webhook Not Triggering:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check webhook configuration\n",
    "kubectl get validatingwebhookconfiguration\n",
    "kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify service endpoints\n",
    "kubectl get endpoints -n security\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check webhook logs\n",
    "kubectl logs -n security -l app=gatekeeper-controller-manager\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Certificate Errors:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Verify CA bundle matches service certificate\n",
    "kubectl get validatingwebhookconfiguration <name> -o yaml | grep caBundle\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check certificate expiration\n",
    "openssl x509 -in <cert-file> -text -noout | grep \"Not After\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Conflicts:**\n",
    "When multiple webhooks conflict:\n",
    "1. Check execution order (mutating before validating)\n",
    "2. Verify reinvocation policies\n",
    "3. Review API server logs for detailed error messages\n",
    "\n",

    "## Chapter Summary and Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explored Kubernetes Admission Controllers as the policy enforcement layer of the API server. We distinguished between **ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks**, which reject non-compliant requests, and **MutatingAdmissionWebhooks**, which modify resources to enforce defaults and inject configurations. Through practical examples, we demonstrated how to build webhook servers that enforce security policies such as prohibiting privileged containers and ensuring resource limits are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "We examined **OPA Gatekeeper** as a production-ready framework for Policy as Code, eliminating the need to maintain custom webhook infrastructure while providing a rich library of pre-built policies. The Rego language enables sophisticated policy logic including context-aware validation and set operations. We covered image admission strategies ensuring only trusted, scanned containers from approved registries execute in the cluster, and resource validation patterns that prevent resource starvation and noisy neighbor scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we explored building **Custom Admission Controllers** using the controller-runtime framework for specialized organizational requirements, including proper certificate management and high-availability deployment patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Always configure webhooks with `failurePolicy: Fail` for security-critical policies to prevent bypass during outages.\n",
    "- Prefer established frameworks like Gatekeeper over custom webhooks unless you require specific integration unavailable in existing solutions.\n",
    "- Ensure mutating webhooks are idempotent to handle retries and multiple mutations gracefully.\n",
    "- Test admission policies thoroughly in CI/CD using OPA's testing framework before deployment.\n",
    "- Monitor webhook latency and availability as they sit in the critical path of API requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Chapter Preview:**\n",
    "Chapter 35: GitOps with ArgoCD introduces a declarative approach to continuous delivery that leverages Git as the single source of truth for infrastructure and application configurations. We will explore how ArgoCD automates the deployment of Kubernetes resources by synchronizing cluster state with Git repositories, implementing the principles of GitOps including automated synchronization, drift detection, and self-healing. The chapter covers ArgoCD architecture, application management, multi-cluster deployments, and integration with admission controllers to create a complete, auditable deployment pipeline that complements the policy enforcement mechanisms established in this chapter."
