    "# Chapter 30: Deployment Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "While Chapter 29 established the conceptual foundation of Continuous Deployment, this chapter examines the tactical implementation of releasing software to production without service interruption. The deployment strategy selected determines the blast radius of potential failures, the speed of rollback, infrastructure costs, and the complexity of monitoring required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern container orchestration platforms—particularly Kubernetes—provide primitive mechanisms supporting multiple deployment strategies. Understanding how to implement Recreate, Rolling Update, Blue-Green, Canary, and Shadow deployments enables teams to match technical capability with risk tolerance and business requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 30.1 Recreate Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The Recreate strategy—also known as the \"big bang\" or \"all-at-once\" deployment—terminates the existing application version before deploying the new version. While conceptually simple, this approach introduces service downtime and significant risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scale current version (V1) to zero replicas\n",
    "2. Wait for termination completion\n",
    "3. Scale new version (V2) to desired replica count\n",
    "4. Verify health\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# Kubernetes Recreate (default when no strategy specified)\n",
    "apiVersion: apps/v1\n",

    "        - containerPort: 8080\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Downtime Calculation:**\n",
    "- Pod termination grace period: 30 seconds (default)\n",
    "- New pod startup time: 10-60 seconds (application-dependent)\n",
    "- **Total downtime:** 40-90 seconds minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Appropriate Scenarios:**\n",
    "- Development environments where downtime is acceptable\n",
    "- Batch processing applications without real-time user traffic\n",
    "- Maintenance windows with explicit downtime communication\n",
    "- Applications requiring exclusive database locks during migration\n",
    "- Legacy monoliths that cannot run multiple versions simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inappropriate for:**\n",
    "- Customer-facing production services\n",
    "- Microservices with high availability SLAs\n",
    "- Real-time transaction processing systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Simplest implementation—no routing logic required\n",
    "- Guaranteed consistency (only one version running at a time)\n",
    "- No database compatibility concerns between versions\n",
    "- Lowest infrastructure cost (no duplicate capacity)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- Complete service downtime during deployment\n",
    "- No gradual rollout or validation capability\n",
    "- All users impacted simultaneously if V2 fails\n",
    "- Slow rollback (must terminate V2, restart V1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Script\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "# recreate-deploy.sh - Manual recreate for non-Kubernetes environments\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stop current version\n",
    "docker-compose stop app\n",
    "docker-compose rm -f app\n",

    "# Database migrations (exclusive lock)\n",
    "docker-compose run --rm app migrate\n",

    "curl -f http://localhost/health || {\n",
    "  echo \"Deployment failed, rolling back...\"\n",
    "  docker-compose stop app\n",
    "  docker-compose rm -f app\n",
    "  docker-compose up -d app --scale app=0  # Scale down\n",
    "  # Restore previous docker-compose.yml and restart\n",
    "  git checkout HEAD~1 -- docker-compose.yml\n",

    "## 30.2 Rolling Update Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling Updates gradually replace old application instances with new ones, maintaining service availability throughout the deployment. Kubernetes Deployments implement this natively as the default strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes replaces pods incrementally based on configurable parameters:\n",
    "\n",

    "          httpGet:\n",
    "            path: /health\n",
    "            port: 8080\n",

    "          initialDelaySeconds: 30\n",
    "          periodSeconds: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Update Process:**\n",
    "1. Create new ReplicaSet with V2 image\n",
    "2. Scale up new ReplicaSet by 1 (or maxSurge percentage)\n",
    "3. Wait for new pod to report Ready (readiness probe passes)\n",
    "4. Scale down old ReplicaSet by 1\n",
    "5. Repeat until all pods updated\n",
    "6. Old ReplicaSet retained for rollback (revision history)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**maxSurge:**\n",
    "- Absolute number or percentage of replicas\n",
    "- Controls how many extra pods can exist during update\n",
    "- Higher = faster deployment, more resource consumption\n",
    "- Example: 10 replicas with maxSurge 30% = up to 13 pods temporarily\n",
    "\n",
    "**maxUnavailable:**\n",
    "- Absolute number or percentage of replicas\n",
    "- Controls minimum availability during update\n",
    "- Higher = faster deployment, lower availability\n",
    "- Example: 10 replicas with maxUnavailable 25% = minimum 7 pods available\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Patterns:**\n",
    "- Conservative: `maxSurge: 1, maxUnavailable: 0` (zero downtime, slow)\n",
    "- Balanced: `maxSurge: 25%, maxUnavailable: 25%` (default)\n",
    "- Aggressive: `maxSurge: 100%, maxUnavailable: 50%` (fast, risky)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monitoring Rolling Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Watch rollout progress\n",
    "kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp --timeout=300s\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check replica distribution\n",
    "kubectl get pods -l app=myapp --show-labels\n",
    "\n",
    "# View rollout history\n",
    "kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pause rollout if issues detected\n",
    "kubectl rollout pause deployment/myapp\n",
    "\n",
    "# Resume after fix\n",
    "kubectl rollout resume deployment/myapp\n",
    "\n",
    "# Rollback to previous version\n",
    "kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp\n",
    "# Or to specific revision\n",
    "kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp --to-revision=3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling updates require backward compatibility during the transition period when both V1 and V2 coexist:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward-Compatible Schema Changes:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Safe for rolling updates: Add nullable column\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- V1 ignores column, V2 uses it\n",
    "-- Safe because nullable doesn't break V1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dangerous Changes (Require coordination):**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- DANGEROUS: Drop column (breaks V1)\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN email;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- DANGEROUS: Rename column (V1 breaks)\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users RENAME COLUMN full_name TO name;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- DANGEROUS: Non-backward compatible type change\n",
    "ALTER TABLE orders ALTER COLUMN total TYPE INTEGER;\n",

    "## Chapter Summary and Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we examined the spectrum of deployment strategies available for modern containerized applications. The Recreate strategy provides simplicity at the cost of downtime, suitable only for non-production or maintenance-window scenarios. Rolling Updates offer zero-downtime deployment with native Kubernetes support but limited risk mitigation—both versions coexist briefly, but all users potentially experience issues if the new version fails. Blue/Green deployment eliminates these concerns by maintaining parallel environments, enabling instantaneous traffic switching and rollback, though at double the infrastructure cost. Canary deployment represents the modern standard for risk-averse organizations, progressively shifting traffic while monitoring health metrics, automatically rolling back when error rates or latency exceed thresholds. A/B Testing extends canary concepts to validate business hypotheses, routing based on user segments rather than random percentages to measure conversion and engagement differences. Shadow deployment provides the safest validation method by mirroring production traffic to the new version without affecting users, though requiring careful application design to prevent duplicate side effects. The selection framework emphasizes matching strategy to availability requirements, with most production systems benefiting from Canary or Blue/Green patterns while simpler internal tools may suffice with Rolling Updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Never use Recreate for customer-facing production services; the downtime and instantaneous 100% user impact violate modern availability expectations\n",
    "- Implement comprehensive readiness and liveness probes for Rolling Updates—without readiness probes, Kubernetes sends traffic to pods still initializing, causing errors during deployment\n",
    "- Blue/Green requires double infrastructure capacity during the deployment window; ensure cluster autoscaling or resource quotas accommodate this, or use spot instances for the idle (Green) environment during validation\n",
    "- Canary deployments require automated metric analysis—manual canary promotion defeats the purpose and introduces human error; implement Flagger, Argo Rollouts, or similar controllers\n",
    "- Database schema changes must remain backward-compatible during rolling and canary deployments; never deploy breaking schema changes without first deploying application code that handles both old and new formats\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Chapter Preview:**\n",
    "Chapter 31: Kubernetes Deployments explores the native Kubernetes abstractions that enable these strategies, examining Deployment controllers, ReplicaSets, rolling update configuration, revision history management, and rollback procedures. We will analyze advanced patterns including paused deployments for canary validation, custom rollout strategies with operators, and integration with service meshes for fine-grained traffic management. This chapter provides the practical implementation details for executing the deployment strategies defined here using Kubernetes-native mechanisms and ecosystem tools."
