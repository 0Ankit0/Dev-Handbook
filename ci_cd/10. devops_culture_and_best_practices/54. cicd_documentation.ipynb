    "# Chapter 54: CI/CD Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation is the institutional memory of engineering organizations. While code describes *what* a system does, documentation explains *why* it exists, *how* to operate it, and *when* to modify it. In CI/CD contexts, documentation serves multiple audiences: developers seeking to understand deployment procedures, operators troubleshooting failed pipelines, auditors verifying compliance controls, and future maintainers inheriting architectural decisions. This chapter treats documentation as code\u2014version controlled, reviewed in pull requests, tested for accuracy, and deployed automatically. We examine **pipeline documentation** that captures the intent behind complex workflows, **architecture documentation** using diagrams-as-code that remain synchronized with implementation, **runbooks** for operational procedures that reduce incident response time, **API documentation** for platform services, **change logs** that communicate breaking changes, **README standards** that serve as service front doors, **automated generation** from source code and schemas, and **documentation-as-code** workflows that prevent the stagnation and rot that plague traditional wikis.\n",

    "## Key Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision: Blue/Green vs Canary\n",
    "**Context**: Need zero-downtime deployment with automatic rollback capability\n",
    "**Decision**: Canary deployment with automatic rollback\n",
    "**Rationale**: \n",
    "  - Blue/green requires 2x capacity which is expensive for payment service\n",
    "  - Canary allows gradual traffic shift with real-user metrics\n",
    "**Consequences**: \n",
    "  - More complex monitoring required\n",
    "  - Longer deployment time (15 min vs 5 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision: Parallel Security Scanning\n",
    "**Context**: Security scans were adding 20 minutes to pipeline\n",
    "**Decision**: Run SAST and dependency scans in parallel with unit tests\n",
    "**Rationale**: \n",
    "  - Security gates shouldn't block fast feedback\n",
    "  - Fail fast on unit tests before expensive scans\n",
    "**Consequences**: \n",
    "  - Requires larger runner instances\n",
    "  - Potential for wasted compute if unit tests fail\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symptom: Canary deployment stays at 5%\n",
    "**Cause**: Metrics verification step failing to query Prometheus\n",
    "**Check**: \n",
    "  1. Verify Prometheus query endpoint: `kubectl get svc prometheus -n monitoring`\n",
    "  2. Check query syntax in `scripts/verify-metrics.sh`\n",
    "  3. Ensure canary pods are emitting metrics: `kubectl logs -l app=payment-canary`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symptom: Automatic rollback not triggering\n",
    "**Cause**: Error rate threshold configuration mismatch\n",
    "**Check**: \n",
    "  1. Verify threshold in workflow env: `CANARY_ERROR_THRESHOLD`\n",
    "  2. Check Prometheus query returns percentage (0.001) not count (1)\n",
    "  3. Ensure alertmanager is routing to webhook\n",

    "## Chapter Summary and Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter established documentation as a critical operational capability for CI/CD platforms, treating docs with the same engineering rigor as production code. We examined **pipeline documentation** that explains not merely the steps executed but the architectural decisions behind deployment strategies, using inline comments, decision records, and troubleshooting guides to capture the \"why\" alongside the \"what.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture documentation** using diagrams-as-code tools (Mermaid, Structurizr, PlantUML) ensures that visual representations remain synchronized with implementation, eliminating the \"architecture diagram vs. reality\" divergence that plagues traditional documentation. These diagrams live in version control, undergo review in pull requests, and render automatically in documentation sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runbooks** provide operational procedures for incident response, structured with clear metadata, diagnosis steps, resolution procedures, and escalation paths. Executable runbooks\u2014tested in CI pipelines\u2014ensure that procedures remain valid as systems evolve, preventing the dangerous scenario where operators discover outdated runbooks during critical incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API documentation** using OpenAPI specifications provides contracts for internal platform services, enabling self-service consumption of CI/CD capabilities by development teams. **Change logs** following structured formats (Keep a Changelog) communicate breaking changes with adequate notice and migration paths, preventing surprise disruptions to dependent teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**README standards** establish the front door to every repository, providing immediate orientation for developers through quick start guides, architecture overviews, configuration references, and links to deeper documentation. **Automated documentation generation** from code annotations, database schemas, and pipeline definitions reduces maintenance burden while ensuring accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **documentation-as-code** workflows\u2014version control, CI/CD linting, link checking, spell checking, and automated deployment\u2014prevent documentation rot by enforcing quality gates and making documentation updates part of the standard development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Treat documentation as code: version controlled, reviewed in PRs, tested in CI, and deployed automatically.\n",
    "- Use diagrams-as-code (Mermaid, Structurizr) to ensure architecture documentation remains synchronized with implementation.\n",
    "- Structure runbooks with clear metadata (severity, owner, related incidents), diagnosis steps, and executable commands that can be tested.\n",
    "- Maintain change logs with breaking change notices and migration guides; provide at least 30 days notice for breaking changes.\n",
    "- Automate documentation generation from OpenAPI specs, code annotations, and infrastructure definitions to reduce maintenance burden.\n",
    "- Include documentation review in Definition of Done; every feature ships with updated docs or it is not complete.\n",
    "- Test documentation accuracy regularly; broken links, outdated screenshots, and incorrect commands erode trust and utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Chapter Preview:** Chapter 55: CI/CD Best Practices synthesizes the patterns and anti-patterns observed throughout this handbook into actionable guidelines. We will examine the **Twelve-Factor App** methodology as it applies to CI/CD, **immutable infrastructure** principles that prevent configuration drift, **infrastructure as code** patterns for reproducible environments, **small frequent changes** that reduce risk and improve debuggability, **automation of toil** that eliminates manual steps, **fail-fast** mechanisms that surface errors immediately, **repeatability** through hermetic builds, and **simplicity** as the ultimate sophistication. We will contrast these with common anti-patterns: the monolithic pipeline, manual interventions, hardcoded configuration, skipped tests in urgency, bloated container images, over-engineered abstractions, siloed team structures, and security as an afterthought. This chapter serves as a concise reference for daily decision-making in pipeline design and implementation."
