    "# Chapter 39: Multi-Environment Deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern applications must traverse multiple environments before reaching production users, each with distinct operational characteristics, security boundaries, and data requirements. Development environments prioritize rapid iteration with synthetic data, staging environments mirror production topology for validation, and production environments demand immutable artifacts with zero-downtime deployments. Managing this progression—environment promotion—requires sophisticated configuration management that maintains artifact immutability while accommodating environmental variance, secure secret handling that prevents credential leakage across boundaries, and database migration strategies that preserve data integrity across schema evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter establishes patterns for reliable environment progression, from local development through production, ensuring that code validated in lower environments behaves predictably when exposed to production traffic and data volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 39.1 Environment Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration varies across environments while application code remains constant. This separation of concerns enables the same container image to execute in development and production, differing only in externalized configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective configuration management follows a hierarchy where defaults are overridden progressively:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Base Configuration (Default values)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Environment Configuration (dev/staging/prod overlays)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Runtime Configuration (Secrets, feature flags)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Configuration (Kustomize):**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# base/deployment.yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: apps/v1\n",
    "kind: Deployment\n",
    "metadata:\n",
    "  name: payment-service\n",
    "spec:\n",
    "  replicas: 1  # Default, overridden per environment\n",
    "  template:\n",
    "    spec:\n",
    "      containers:\n",
    "      - name: payment\n",
    "        image: payment-service:latest  # Replaced by CI/CD\n",
    "        env:\n",
    "        - name: LOG_LEVEL\n",
    "          value: \"info\"  # Default, overridden in dev for verbosity\n",
    "        - name: DB_POOL_SIZE\n",
    "          value: \"10\"    # Base value\n",
    "        resources:\n",
    "          requests:\n",
    "            memory: \"256Mi\"  # Minimum viable\n",
    "            cpu: \"100m\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The base configuration defines sensible defaults that allow the application to run. The `replicas: 1` supports local development, while `LOG_LEVEL: info` provides standard observability. These values are intentionally conservative, suitable for development environments, with production overrides increasing resource allocations and replica counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kustomize Environment Overlays\n",
    "\n",
    "Kustomize provides a declarative approach to environment-specific customization without template duplication:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This Kustomize overlay transforms the base configuration for production:\n",
    "- **namespace**: Isolates resources in the `production` namespace\n",
    "- **namePrefix**: Prefixes all resources with `prod-` (e.g., `prod-payment-service`)\n",
    "- **commonLabels**: Adds labels for monitoring and cost allocation\n",
    "- **patches**: Applies strategic merge patches to increase resources, add HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA), and PodDisruptionBudget (PDB)\n",
    "- **configMapGenerator**: Merges with base ConfigMap, overriding `LOG_LEVEL` to `warn` (reducing noise) and increasing `DB_POOL_SIZE` to `50` for production load\n",
    "- **replicas**: Overrides the base `replicas: 1` with `5` for high availability\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The patch modifies specific fields of the base Deployment:\n",
    "- **Resources**: Increases memory and CPU allocations for production workload\n",
    "- **JAVA_OPTS**: Tunes JVM garbage collection (G1GC) and heap sizing for containerized environments\n",
    "- **SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE**: Activates production-specific Spring profiles\n",
    "- **Probes**: Extends initial delay seconds to account for production database connection pool initialization and JVM warm-up\n",

    "Argo Rollouts performs a canary deployment: 20% traffic to new version, waits 10 minutes, analyzes Prometheus metrics for 99% success rate. If success rate drops below 99%, it automatically rolls back to v2.1.0 without human intervention. This prevents faulty deployments from impacting all users.\n",

    "### Database Rollback Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling back application code without rolling back database migrations causes schema-version mismatch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Safe rollback procedure\n",
    "1. kubectl rollout undo deployment/payment-service  # Rollback app\n",
    "2. Check if DB migrations are backward compatible\n",
    "   - If yes: No action needed\n",
    "   - If no: Restore from pre-migration backup\n",
    "3. Verify application starts with current DB schema\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backward Compatible Migration Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- V2.1.0__add_user_preferences.sql (Expand)\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN preferences JSONB;\n",
    "-- Old code ignores new column (safe)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- V2.2.0__migrate_preferences.sql (Contract - weeks later)\n",
    "UPDATE users SET preferences = migrate_legacy_format(old_column);\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN old_column;\n",
    "-- Only drop after all apps updated\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The expand-contract pattern ensures migrations are backward compatible. New columns are added (expand) but old columns remain until all services are updated (contract). This allows application rollback without database restoration, as the previous app version simply ignores the new columns.\n",

    "## Chapter Summary and Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter established comprehensive patterns for managing microservices deployments across multiple environments while maintaining security boundaries and operational reliability. We examined configuration management strategies using Kustomize overlays and Helm values hierarchies, enabling the same container image to execute across development, staging, and production with environment-specific tuning for resource allocation, logging verbosity, and feature enablement. The critical distinction between configuration data (ConfigMaps) and sensitive credentials (Secrets) was addressed through Sealed Secrets for Git-safe encryption and External Secrets Operator for dynamic integration with cloud secret managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment promotion strategies in GitOps workflows treat progression as Git operations—merging tested configurations from staging directories to production—ensuring immutable artifact promotion and comprehensive audit trails through pull request history. Database migration strategies emphasized the expand-contract pattern for zero-downtime schema evolution, with environment-specific automation levels ranging from automatic migrations in development to scheduled maintenance windows with pre-migration backups in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drift detection mechanisms using ArgoCD self-healing or periodic auditing scripts ensure manual cluster interventions are detected and corrected, maintaining the declarative state defined in version control. Emergency procedures for hotfixes and automated rollbacks using canary analysis provide safety nets for production incidents while preserving the integrity of the mainline codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Maintain artifact immutability across environments—promote the exact image digest tested in staging to production, varying only external configuration via ConfigMaps and Secrets.\n",
    "- Use Kustomize overlays or Helm values files to manage environment-specific configurations without duplicating base manifests, ensuring changes propagate consistently across environments.\n",
    "- Implement the expand-contract pattern for database migrations: add new structures in one release (expand), migrate data, then remove old structures in subsequent releases (contract) to enable safe application rollbacks.\n",
    "- Store secrets in external secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault) synchronized to Kubernetes via External Secrets Operator, enabling automatic rotation without application restarts.\n",
    "- Enable automated drift detection and self-healing in production to prevent configuration rot, but implement ignore rules for fields managed by other controllers (HPA replica counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Chapter Preview:**\n",
    "Chapter 40: Progressive Delivery explores advanced deployment strategies that minimize risk when releasing new versions to production. We will examine canary deployments that shift traffic gradually while analyzing metrics, blue-green deployments that enable instant cutover and rollback, feature flags that decouple deployment from release, and A/B testing frameworks for data-driven feature validation. The chapter covers service mesh integration (Istio, Linkerd) for traffic management, automated analysis and promotion pipelines, and strategies for handling long-running transactions during gradual rollouts, building upon the multi-environment foundations to achieve zero-downtime deployments with measurable safety guarantees."
