    "# Chapter 38: Monorepo vs. Polyrepo\n",
    "\n",
    "The organizational structure of code repositories fundamentally shapes how teams collaborate, how continuous integration pipelines execute, and how dependencies flow through a microservices architecture. This architectural decision\u2014whether to consolidate all code into a single repository (monorepo) or distribute it across multiple repositories (polyrepo)\u2014impacts build performance, access control, versioning strategies, and developer workflow efficiency. Neither approach is universally superior; each optimizes for different organizational constraints, team scales, and deployment patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter examines the structural, technical, and organizational implications of monorepo and polyrepo strategies. We analyze build tooling optimizations for massive codebases, dependency management patterns that prevent version drift, CI pipeline designs that handle sparse changes efficiently, and governance models that maintain code quality across organizational boundaries. By understanding the trade-offs between atomic commits across services and independent repository lifecycles, organizations can select the appropriate structure for their specific context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 38.1 Monorepo Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "A monorepo consolidates all microservices, shared libraries, infrastructure code, and documentation into a single version control repository. This approach, famously employed by Google, Meta, and Netflix, enables atomic changes across multiple services while introducing challenges in build performance and access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repository Structure\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Organizational Principles:**\n",
    "- **Apps**: Contain deployable units (microservices) with independent CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "- **Libs**: Shared code consumed by multiple services but not deployed independently\n",
    "- **Infra**: Cross-cutting infrastructure definitions\n",
    "- **Docs**: Living documentation versioned with code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atomic Commits Across Services\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of monorepos is the ability to modify multiple services in a single commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Example: Adding a new field to the Payment API affects multiple services\n",
    "git diff HEAD~1 --name-only\n",
    "\n",
    "apps/payment-service/src/main/java/com/company/payment/PaymentRequest.java\n",
    "apps/order-service/src/main/java/com/company/order/PaymentClient.java\n",
    "libs/event-contracts/proto/payment_events.proto\n",
    "infra/terraform/api-gateway/payment_routes.tf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commit Message Convention:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "feat(payment): Add installment payment option\n",
    "\n",
    "- Update PaymentRequest to support installment plans\n",
    "- Modify Order Service to calculate installment schedules\n",
    "- Update API Gateway routes for new endpoints\n",
    "- Add event schema for installment.created\n",
    "\n",
    "BREAKING CHANGE: PaymentRequest now requires paymentType field\n",
    "Refs: JIRA-1234\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This commit touches four components atomically. If any part fails CI, the entire commit is rejected, preventing partial deployments that could leave the system in an inconsistent state. The breaking change notice triggers semantic versioning analysis in CI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sparse Checkouts\n",
    "\n",
    "For developers working on specific services, Git sparse checkouts reduce clone time and working directory size:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Configure sparse checkout\n",
    "git sparse-checkout init --cone\n",
    "\n",
    "# Only checkout payment-service and shared libs\n",
    "git sparse-checkout set apps/payment-service libs/shared-kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "# Result: Working directory contains only these paths\n",
    "# Other services exist in Git history but not locally\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Sparse checkout uses the \"cone\" mode (directory-based) to include only specified directories. Developers working exclusively on Payment Service don't need Order Service code locally, reducing disk usage and IDE indexing time while maintaining the ability to commit cross-service changes when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 38.2 Polyrepo Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Polyrepos distribute microservices across independent repositories, typically one per service or one per team. Each repository maintains independent versioning, CI/CD pipelines, and release cycles.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Semantic Versioning for Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Polyrepos rely heavily on semantic versioning to manage cross-service dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "// order-service/package.json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"order-service\",\n",
    "  \"version\": \"2.1.0\",\n",
    "  \"dependencies\": {\n",
    "    \"@company/event-contracts\": \"^1.2.0\",\n",
    "    \"@company/observability\": \"~3.0.5\",\n",
    "    \"axios\": \"^1.6.0\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version Constraint Explanation:**\n",
    "- `^1.2.0`: Compatible with 1.2.0 and above, but less than 2.0.0 (allows minor and patch updates)\n",
    "- `~3.0.5`: Approximately equivalent to 3.0.5, allows only patch updates (3.0.x)\n",
    "- Exact versions (`1.2.0`): Pinned to specific version for reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lock Files:**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "// package-lock.json (excerpt)\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"@company/event-contracts\",\n",
    "  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n",
    "  \"resolved\": \"https://npm.company.com/@company/event-contracts/-/event-contracts-1.2.3.tgz\",\n",
    "  \"integrity\": \"sha512-abc123...\",\n",
    "  \"dependencies\": {\n",
    "    \"protobufjs\": \"^7.2.0\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, poetry.lock) freeze the entire dependency tree to specific versions. When CI checks out the code, it installs exactly the versions specified in the lock file, ensuring reproducible builds even if upstream packages release new versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submodule and Subtree Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "For shared code, polyrepos use Git submodules or subtrees:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Adding shared contracts as submodule\n",
    "git submodule add https://github.com/company/shared-contracts.git contracts/\n",
    "\n",
    "# .gitmodules file created:\n",
    "[submodule \"contracts\"]\n",
    "    path = contracts\n",
    "    url = https://github.com/company/shared-contracts.git\n",
    "    branch = main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**CI Update Script:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# .github/workflows/update-contracts.yml\n",
    "name: Update Contracts\n",
    "on:\n",
    "  schedule:\n",
    "    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM\n",
    "\n",
    "jobs:\n",
    "  update:\n",
    "    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n",
    "    steps:\n",
    "      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n",
    "        with:\n",
    "          submodules: recursive\n",
    "      \n",
    "      - name: Update Submodule\n",
    "        run: |\n",
    "          git submodule update --remote --merge\n",
    "          if [[ -n $(git status --porcelain) ]]; then\n",
    "            git add contracts/\n",
    "            git commit -m \"chore: Update shared contracts to latest\"\n",
    "            git push origin HEAD:main\n",
    "          fi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This workflow automatically updates the submodule reference daily. If new commits exist in the shared-contracts repository, the submodule pointer updates and commits the change, triggering the service's CI pipeline to test against the latest contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 38.3 Build Tooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Build tooling requirements differ dramatically between monorepos and polyrepos, particularly regarding incremental builds and change detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monorepo Build Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nx (JavaScript/TypeScript):**\n",
    "Nx provides intelligent caching and task orchestration for JavaScript monorepos.\n",

    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This configuration defines:\n",
    "- **Cacheable Operations**: Results of build, test, and lint are cached in `node_modules/.cache/nx`\n",
    "- **Named Inputs**: `production` excludes test files from build hashes\n",
    "- **Target Defaults**: `dependsOn: [\"^build\"]` ensures dependencies build first (the `^` indicates upstream dependencies)\n",

    "# Only build projects affected by current branch changes\n",
    "nx affected --target=build --base=main --head=HEAD\n",
    "\n",
    "# Result: Builds only payment-service and order-service if \n",
    "# shared-kernel changed and both depend on it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "`nx affected` analyzes the Git diff between `main` and `HEAD`, builds a dependency graph, and executes targets only for projects with modified source files or dependencies. This prevents rebuilding the entire monorepo when only one service changes.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `java_library` compiles source files with dependencies on the shared kernel and external Maven artifacts\n",
    "- `java_binary` creates an executable JAR with the specified main class\n",
    "- `java_image` (from rules_docker) builds a minimal Docker image containing only the JAR and its runtime dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bazel Query for CI:**\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Turborepo's pipeline defines task dependencies. The `^` in `^build` indicates that a package's build task depends on its dependencies' build tasks first. Outputs are cached based on input file hashes, enabling instant replay of builds when no source files change.\n",

    "### Polyrepo Build Optimization\n",

    "## Chapter Summary and Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter analyzed the structural foundations of microservices development through the lens of repository organization strategies. Monorepos consolidate all services into a single version control repository, enabling atomic commits across service boundaries and facilitating large-scale refactoring through tools like Nx, Bazel, and Turborepo that provide intelligent change detection and build caching. However, this approach introduces challenges in access control granularity, repository scaling, and the potential for tight coupling through excessive shared code dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polyrepos distribute services across independent repositories, providing strong isolation boundaries, independent release cycles, and natural technology heterogeneity. This approach excels in organizations prioritizing service autonomy and team independence but introduces friction in cross-service refactoring, version drift risks in shared dependencies, and the operational overhead of coordinating changes across repository boundaries through semantic versioning and artifact publishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We examined build tooling optimizations essential for monorepo scale, including sparse checkouts to reduce working directory size, affected commands to minimize CI execution to changed components, and remote caching to share build artifacts across developer machines. For polyrepos, we explored Bill of Materials (BOM) patterns for version alignment and cross-repository triggering mechanisms to maintain integration integrity. Code ownership strategies through CODEOWNERS files and repository-level permissions provide governance appropriate to each model's access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Choose monorepos when your architecture requires frequent cross-service refactoring and you can invest in build tooling (Bazel/Nx) to handle scale; choose polyrepos when team autonomy and independent deployment velocity outweigh the costs of cross-repository coordination.\n",
    "- In monorepos, implement affected commands and change detection to prevent CI pipeline explosion, ensuring only modified services and their dependents execute tests.\n",
    "- In polyrepos, maintain strict semantic versioning discipline for shared libraries, utilizing automated dependency update tools (Renovate, Dependabot) to prevent version drift.\n",
    "- Use CODEOWNERS in monorepos to enforce domain expert review despite open access to all code; use repository permissions in polyrepos to enforce architectural boundaries.\n",
    "- Consider hybrid approaches (monorepo for shared contracts, polyrepo for implementations) to balance atomic change capability with deployment independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Chapter Preview:**\n",
    "Chapter 39: Multi-Environment Deployments explores strategies for managing configuration and deployment across development, staging, and production environments. We will examine environment promotion strategies that ensure artifact immutability while allowing configuration variance, techniques for managing environment-specific secrets and configurations without code duplication, and patterns for database migration coordination across environments. The chapter covers GitOps approaches to multi-environment management, drift detection between environments, and strategies for hotfixes and rollbacks when production issues arise, building upon the repository structures established in this chapter to create reliable promotion pipelines from development workstations to production clusters."
