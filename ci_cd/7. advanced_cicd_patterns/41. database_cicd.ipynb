    "# Chapter 41: Database CI/CD\n",
    "\n",
    "Database schema changes present unique challenges in continuous delivery pipelines. Unlike application code, which can be rolled back by redeploying a previous container image, database schema modifications are persistent and often irreversible. A dropped column cannot be restored by rolling back application code, and schema changes that lock tables for extended periods can cause production outages. Furthermore, microservices architectures mandate that each service owns its data, requiring coordination between application deployment and database migration timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter establishes patterns for safely evolving database schemas within CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that application deployments and schema changes remain compatible across versions. We examine migration-based schema management, testing strategies for database changes, backward compatibility patterns that enable zero-downtime deployments, and rollback procedures for when migrations fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 41.1 Database Migration Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Database migrations transform schema from one version to another while preserving data. Unlike application code deployments that replace binaries, migrations modify persistent state that must remain available throughout the deployment process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Migration-Based Schema Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Migration tools track schema versions in metadata tables, ensuring each change executes exactly once across all environments.\n",

    "- `U{version}__{description}.sql`: Undo migrations for rollback (Flyway Teams/Enterprise)\n",
    "- `R__{description}.sql`: Repeatable migrations executed whenever checksum changes (views, stored procedures)\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The configuration disables `clean` (which drops all objects) in production to prevent catastrophic data loss. Placeholders allow SQL parameterization for environment-specific values (schema owners, tablespaces). The `validateOnMigrate` ensures migration files haven't been modified after application—Flyway calculates checksums and fails if a previously applied migration changed, preventing drift.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Liquibase tracks changes via `databasechangelog` table. Each `changeSet` has an ID and author, forming a composite key. The `rollback` tags define how to reverse changes (used by `liquibase rollback` commands). XML format provides better database abstraction than SQL—Liquibase translates `JSONB` to appropriate types for PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle automatically.\n",

    "## 41.2 Schema Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema versioning ensures that application version N is compatible with database schema version M, enabling safe rollbacks and blue-green deployments.\n",

    "| 2.0.9 | 14 | Read-only (backward compatible) |\n",
    "| 2.1.0 | 14 | Forward compatible (new code, old schema) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application Startup Check:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Component\n",
    "public class SchemaVersionChecker implements CommandLineRunner {\n",
    "    \n",

    "            Integer.class\n",
    "        );\n",
    "        \n",
    "        if (currentVersion == null || currentVersion < minSchemaVersion) {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The checker queries Flyway's history table on startup, verifying the database schema meets the application's minimum requirements. This prevents application crashes from missing columns or tables, failing fast during deployment rather than at runtime when features access non-existent schema elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Migration Versioning Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timestamp vs. Sequential:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Sequential (Flyway default)\n",
    "V1__create_users.sql\n",
    "V2__add_preferences.sql\n",
    "\n",
    "# Timestamp (useful for parallel development)\n",
    "V20240115120000__create_users.sql\n",
    "V20240115123000__add_preferences.sql\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:**\n",
    "Use sequential numbers for small teams, timestamps for large teams where multiple developers might create migrations simultaneously. Timestamps prevent version conflicts when merging feature branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 41.3 Testing Database Changes\n",

    "    @Column(nullable = false)\n",
    "    private String email;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // New field added, but old code ignores it\n",
    "    @Column(nullable = false)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Phase 2: Migrate Data (Deploy 2)**\n",

    "-- Only after all old app instances stopped\n",
    "-- ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN old_status;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Expand**: Add new column with defaults, ensuring old code continues working (ignores new column)\n",
    "- **Contract**: Remove old columns only after new code is fully deployed and stable\n",
    "- **Concurrent Indexes**: `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` prevents table locks during index creation, allowing reads/writes to continue\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blue-Green Safe Schema Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Safe: Add nullable column\n",
    "ALTER TABLE orders \n",

    "-- Safe: Add table with foreign key (new table, no existing data)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Adding nullable columns and new tables is always safe because existing code doesn't reference them. Dropping or renaming columns breaks old application versions still running during deployment. Adding non-nullable columns without defaults fails on existing rows.\n",

    "    --chunk-size 1000 \\\n",
    "    --progress percentage,10 \\\n",
    "    D=payments,t=users,u=admin,p=password\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "`pt-online-schema-change` creates a new table with the altered schema, copies data in chunks (1000 rows at a time), tracks changes via triggers, and swaps tables atomically. The `--max-load` parameter pauses copying if server load exceeds thresholds, preventing performance degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**gh-ost (GitHub Online Schema Transformer):**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gh-ost \\\n",
    "  --database=payments \\\n",

    "  --chunk-size=1000 \\\n",
    "  --throttle-control-replicas=\"replica1,replica2\" \\\n",
    "  --initially-drop-ghost-table \\\n",
    "  --initially-drop-old-table\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "`gh-ost` uses binary log streaming instead of triggers (less overhead than pt-online-schema-change), throttles based on replication lag, and provides progress feedback. It works by creating a \"ghost\" table, streaming changes from the binlog, and cutting over via atomic rename.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PostgreSQL Specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- PostgreSQL supports transactional DDL\n",

    "## Chapter Summary and Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter addressed the critical intersection of database schema management and continuous delivery, establishing patterns for safely evolving persistent data structures without service interruption. We examined migration-based schema management using Flyway and Liquibase, which track applied changes in metadata tables to ensure idempotent, ordered execution across environments. The expand-contract pattern emerged as the fundamental strategy for zero-downtime schema changes, separating the addition of new structures (expand) from the removal of old structures (contract) across multiple deployment cycles, ensuring backward compatibility between application versions and database schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing strategies using Testcontainers provide confidence that migrations execute correctly and performantly against production-like data volumes, while online schema change tools (pt-online-schema-change, gh-ost) prevent table locking during large-scale alterations. The database-per-service pattern enforces microservices boundaries, preventing tight coupling through shared database tables while requiring careful coordination of distributed transactions and eventual consistency patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rollback strategies distinguish between application-level rollbacks (safe when schemas are backward compatible) and database-level rollbacks (requiring undo migrations or point-in-time recovery from backups). CI/CD integration ensures migrations pass validation gates, execute in isolated staging environments, and trigger only after protective backups in production, with Kubernetes Jobs providing the execution context for schema changes within containerized environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Always use the expand-contract pattern for schema changes: add new columns/tables in one release (expand), migrate data and update applications, then remove old structures in subsequent releases (contract).\n",
    "- Never drop or rename columns immediately; maintain backward compatibility so old application versions can run against new schemas during rolling deployments.\n",
    "- Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` in PostgreSQL or online schema change tools (gh-ost, pt-online-schema-change) for large tables to prevent table locking and application downtime.\n",
    "- Store migrations in version control alongside application code, but execute them via separate CI/CD jobs or Kubernetes Init Containers before application startup, using tools like Flyway or Liquibase for tracking and ordering.\n",
    "- Implement idempotent migrations (safe to re-run) and always backup production databases before applying migrations, with automated rollback procedures tested in staging environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Chapter Preview:**\n",
    "Chapter 42: Infrastructure as Code in CI/CD explores managing cloud infrastructure through declarative configuration files versioned alongside application code. We will examine Terraform workflows for creating and modifying cloud resources (VPCs, databases, Kubernetes clusters) within CI/CD pipelines, handling state management and locking to prevent conflicts, implementing plan/apply stages for safe infrastructure changes, and strategies for drift detection when manual console changes occur. The chapter covers modular infrastructure design, secret management for cloud credentials, and integration with policy-as-code frameworks to ensure infrastructure compliance, extending the database and application deployment patterns to the underlying infrastructure layer."
