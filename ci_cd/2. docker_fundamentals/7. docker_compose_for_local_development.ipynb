    "**Chapter 7: Docker Compose for Local Development**\n",
    "\n",
    "Single containers are insufficient for modern applications. A typical web service requires a database, cache, message queue, and possibly additional microservices. **Docker Compose** is the local orchestration tool that defines and runs multi-container applications. This chapter teaches you to replicate production architectures on your development machine\u2014ensuring that what you build locally behaves identically to what deploys to Kubernetes clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Docker Compose Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a declarative YAML configuration file. While Kubernetes orchestrates containers at scale in production, Compose provides the same orchestration paradigm for local development.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem Compose Solves\n",
    "\n",
    "Without Compose, starting a full application stack requires multiple terminal windows and complex `docker run` commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Manual approach (error-prone and tedious)\n",
    "docker network create app-network\n",
    "\n",
    "docker run -d --name postgres \\\n",
    "  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \\\n",
    "  -v postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\\n",
    "  --network app-network \\\n",
    "  postgres:15\n",
    "\n",
    "docker run -d --name redis \\\n",
    "  --network app-network \\\n",
    "  redis:7\n",
    "\n",
    "docker run -d --name api \\\n",
    "  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:secret@postgres:5432/app \\\n",
    "  -e REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379 \\\n",
    "  -p 3000:3000 \\\n",
    "  --network app-network \\\n",
    "  myapp:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Compose**, a single file defines the entire stack, started with one command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker compose up -d\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compose vs. Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "While both use declarative YAML and similar concepts (services, networks, volumes), they serve different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Docker Compose | Kubernetes |\n",
    "|--------|---------------|------------|\n",
    "| **Scope** | Single host (laptop/single server) | Distributed cluster (many nodes) |\n",
    "| **Complexity** | Simple, batteries included | Complex, highly configurable |\n",
    "| **Production** | Not recommended (use Swarm or K8s) | Industry standard |\n",
    "| **Scaling** | Limited (`scale` command) | Advanced (HPA, cluster autoscaling) |\n",
    "| **Networking** | Automatic bridge networks | CNI plugins, ingress controllers |\n",
    "| **Storage** | Local volumes only | PersistentVolumes, StorageClasses |\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Development Contract:** If it works in Compose, it should work in Kubernetes. Compose validates your containerization logic before you pay the complexity cost of Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker Compose is now included with Docker Desktop. For Linux, install separately:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install Compose plugin (modern method)\n",
    "docker compose version  # Check if installed\n",
    "\n",
    "# If not installed:\n",
    "sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin\n",
    "# OR\n",
    "sudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n",
    "sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Modern Docker uses `docker compose` (space, plugin) while legacy uses `docker-compose` (hyphen, Python binary). This chapter uses the modern plugin syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** Compose is the **local Kubernetes equivalent**\u2014providing service discovery, networking, and volume management for multi-container applications on a single machine. It bridges the gap between `docker run` and production orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 compose.yaml Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The Compose Specification uses `compose.yaml` (or `compose.yml`) as the default filename (though `docker-compose.yml` remains supported for backwards compatibility). This file defines services, networks, volumes, and configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top-Level Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# compose.yaml\n",
    "name: myapp  # Project name (prefixes containers, networks, volumes)\n",
    "\n",
    "services:    # Containers to run\n",
    "  # ... service definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "networks:    # Custom networks (optional, defaults created automatically)\n",
    "  # ... network definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "volumes:     # Named volumes for persistence\n",
    "  # ... volume definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "configs:     # Configuration files (similar to K8s ConfigMaps)\n",

    "\n",
    "secrets:     # Sensitive data (similar to K8s Secrets)\n",
    "  # ... secret definitions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Service Definition Anatomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Each service maps to a container and supports extensive configuration:\n",

    "docker compose config --volumes\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Key Takeaway:** The `compose.yaml` file is a **contract** between your application's components. It explicitly declares dependencies, network topology, and resource requirements\u2014making implicit assumptions explicit and version-controlled.\n",

    "### 7.3 Defining Services\n",

    "Services in Compose correspond to the containers we built in Chapter 6. Here we define how those containers interact.\n",

    "Use profiles to define optional services (e.g., debugging tools) that don't start by default:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "services:\n",

    "### 7.4 Networking in Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Compose creates a single bridge network for your application. All services can resolve each other by service name (DNS).\n",

    "```yaml\n",
    "services:\n",

    "    image: postgres:15\n",
    "    # Can reach api at hostname: api\n",

    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you mastered local multi-container orchestration with Docker Compose. You learned to structure **`compose.yaml`** files defining services, networks, and volumes, implemented **service discovery** using DNS names identical to Kubernetes, configured **persistence** with named volumes for databases and bind mounts for development, managed **environment configuration** through `.env` files and secrets, designed **complete application stacks** with health checks and network isolation, and separated **development and production** concerns using override files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compose enables you to validate your entire application architecture locally before committing to cloud resources. The patterns you learned\u2014service dependencies, network tiers, and persistent volumes\u2014translate directly to Kubernetes concepts, making this the perfect bridge between single-container development and production orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Chapter 8: Advanced Docker Techniques**, we elevate your containerization skills to production grade. You will master **multi-stage builds** for minimal image sizes, optimize **layer caching** to accelerate CI/CD pipelines, implement **BuildKit** features for mounting secrets and SSH keys securely, and configure **non-root users** with proper signal handling. These advanced techniques transform working containers into enterprise-grade artifacts optimized for security, speed, and resource efficiency\u2014the final preparation before we deploy to Kubernetes clusters in Part III."
