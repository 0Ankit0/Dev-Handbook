    "# Chapter 10: Docker Security Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Security in containerized environments requires a defense-in-depth approach. While Docker provides isolation mechanisms, containers share the host kernel, making security misconfigurations potentially catastrophic. This chapter covers industry-standard practices endorsed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), NIST, and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to secure your containers throughout their lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.1 Running as Non-Root User\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Docker containers run as the `root` user (UID 0). This is dangerous because if an attacker compromises the application, they gain root privileges inside the container, and potentially on the host if container escape vulnerabilities exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "When a container runs as root:\n",
    "- **Container Escape**: Kernel exploits become more severe since the escaped process has root privileges on the host\n",
    "- **Filesystem Access**: Unrestricted access to container filesystems\n",
    "- **Process Visibility**: Ability to see and potentially interact with host processes\n",
    "- **Resource Exhaustion**: No limits on resource consumption (unless explicitly set)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create a Dedicated User in Dockerfile\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# Bad Practice - Running as root (default)\n",
    "FROM node:18\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "RUN npm install\n",
    "CMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Good Practice - Running as non-root\n",
    "FROM node:18\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a non-root user and group\n",
    "RUN groupadd -r appgroup && useradd -r -g appgroup appuser\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set working directory with proper ownership\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy files with specific ownership\n",
    "COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup . .\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install dependencies (requires root temporarily)\n",
    "RUN npm install\n",
    "\n",
    "# Switch to non-root user\n",
    "USER appuser\n",
    "\n",
    "# Expose port (doesn't require privileges)\n",
    "EXPOSE 3000\n",
    "\n",
    "CMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Using Numeric UID/GID\n",
    "\n",
    "Always use numeric IDs instead of usernames to prevent conflicts with host user namespaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# Better approach - Using numeric IDs\n",
    "FROM alpine:latest\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create user with specific UID/GID\n",
    "RUN addgroup -g 1000 -S appgroup && \\\n",
    "    adduser -u 1000 -S appuser -G appgroup\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify the user exists\n",
    "RUN id appuser\n",
    "\n",
    "USER 1000:1000\n",
    "\n",
    "CMD [\"sh\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry Standard**: Use UID/GID 1000 or higher to avoid conflicts with system users (0-999).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Handling Permission Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Some applications need specific capabilities. Instead of running as root, grant specific capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM nginx:alpine\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create non-root user\n",
    "RUN adduser -D -u 1000 nginxuser\n",
    "\n",
    "# Change nginx to listen on unprivileged port (8080 instead of 80)\n",
    "RUN sed -i 's/listen\\s*80;/listen 8080;/g' /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && \\\n",
    "    sed -i 's/user\\s*nginx;/user nginxuser;/g' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adjust permissions for non-root user\n",
    "RUN chown -R nginxuser:nginxuser /var/cache/nginx /var/log/nginx /etc/nginx/conf.d\n",
    "\n",
    "USER nginxuser\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPOSE 8080\n",
    "\n",
    "CMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Runtime Enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the Dockerfile specifies a user, enforce it at runtime:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Explicitly specify user at runtime\n",
    "docker run --user 1000:1000 -d myimage\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prevent privilege escalation\n",
    "docker run --security-opt=no-new-privileges:true -d myimage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice**: Combine `USER` instruction in Dockerfile with `--user` flag at runtime for defense in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.2 Minimal Base Images\n",
    "\n",
    "The attack surface of a container is directly proportional to the code it contains. Traditional base images like Ubuntu or Debian include hundreds of packages you don't need, each potentially containing vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Strategy Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scratch**: Empty image (ideal for static binaries)\n",
    "2. **Distroless**: Contains only runtime dependencies (Google's approach)\n",
    "3. **Alpine**: Minimal Linux distribution (~5MB)\n",
    "4. **Slim variants**: Debian/Ubuntu minimal versions\n",
    "5. **Full distributions**: Only when necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Distroless Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Google's distroless images contain only your application and its runtime dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# Build stage\n",
    "FROM node:18 AS builder\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "COPY package*.json ./\n",
    "RUN npm ci --only=production\n",
    "\n",
    "# Production stage - Distroless\n",
    "FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs18-debian11\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy from builder with specific user permissions\n",
    "COPY --from=builder --chown=nonroot:nonroot /app/node_modules ./node_modules\n",
    "COPY --from=builder --chown=nonroot:nonroot /app/package*.json ./\n",
    "COPY --chown=nonroot:nonroot . .\n",
    "\n",
    "USER nonroot\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPOSE 3000\n",
    "\n",
    "CMD [\"server.js\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Distroless:**\n",
    "- No shell (`sh`, `bash`) for attackers to access\n",
    "- No package manager (`apt`, `apk`)\n",
    "- No unnecessary utilities (`curl`, `wget`, `ssh`)\n",
    "- Minimal attack surface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Alpine Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need a package manager but want minimal size:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.11-alpine\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install security updates and required packages\n",
    "RUN apk update && \\\n",
    "    apk upgrade && \\\n",
    "    apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev && \\\n",
    "    rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create non-root user\n",
    "RUN addgroup -g 1000 -S appgroup && \\\n",
    "    adduser -u 1000 -S appuser -G appgroup\n",
    "\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "COPY requirements.txt .\n",
    "RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "\n",
    "USER appuser\n",
    "\n",
    "CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Alpine uses `musl libc` instead of `glibc`, which can cause compatibility issues with some applications. Test thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Stage Builds for Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate build tools from runtime:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# Build stage - Full toolchain\n",
    "FROM golang:1.21 AS builder\n",
    "WORKDIR /src\n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Runtime stage - Scratch\n",
    "FROM scratch\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy CA certificates for HTTPS\n",
    "COPY --from=builder /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy binary\n",
    "COPY --from=builder /src/app .\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use non-root user (must be numeric in scratch)\n",
    "USER 1000:1000\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPOSE 8080\n",
    "\n",
    "ENTRYPOINT [\"./app\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "Always verify minimal images contain only what you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check image layers\n",
    "docker history myimage\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inspect image contents\n",
    "docker run --rm -it myimage sh\n",
    "# (For distroless, use debug tags or dive tool instead)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use dive tool for analysis\n",
    "dive myimage:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.3 Secrets Management in Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardcoding secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) in images is a critical security violation. Secrets in image layers persist even if removed in later layers due to Docker's layered filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Layer Problem\n",

    "docker history myimage\n",
    "# Or extract layers\n",
    "docker save myimage -o image.tar\n",
    "tar -xf image.tar\n",

    "\n",
    "### Build-Time Secrets (BuildKit)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Docker BuildKit to mount secrets that don't persist in layers:\n",

    "## Chapter Summary and Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we established comprehensive security practices for Docker containers, covering the principle of least privilege through non-root execution, attack surface reduction via minimal base images, secrets management avoiding layer persistence, vulnerability scanning integration, cryptographic verification with Docker Content Trust, network segmentation strategies, resource-based DoS prevention, and kernel-level hardening using AppArmor and Seccomp.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Never run containers as root; always specify USER directives with numeric IDs\n",
    "- Prefer distroless or Alpine images to minimize attack surface\n",
    "- Use BuildKit secrets for build-time credentials and runtime secret injection for operational secrets\n",
    "- Scan images at every pipeline stage with tools like Trivy or Clair\n",
    "- Enable Docker Content Trust to ensure image authenticity\n",
    "- Implement defense in depth combining capabilities dropping, security profiles, and read-only filesystems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Chapter Preview:**\n",
    "Chapter 11: Docker Registries will build upon these security foundations by teaching you how to securely store and distribute your hardened images. You'll learn about private registry options (AWS ECR, Google GCR, Azure ACR, Harbor), authentication mechanisms, image tagging strategies for traceability, and how to implement vulnerability scanning at the registry level to prevent compromised images from ever reaching your Kubernetes clusters."
