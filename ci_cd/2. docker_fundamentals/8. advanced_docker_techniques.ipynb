    "\n",
    "Basic Dockerfiles create functional containers; production environments demand optimized, secure, and efficient artifacts. This chapter explores advanced patterns that reduce image size, accelerate build times, harden security postures, and ensure reliable runtime behavior. These techniques separate development experiments from enterprise-grade containerization ready for Kubernetes orchestration.\n",

    "### 8.1 Multi-Stage Builds\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple `FROM` statements in a single Dockerfile. Each stage can use a different base, and you can selectively copy artifacts between stages, leaving behind build tools, source code, and intermediate files in the final image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Builder Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate compilation/build tools from runtime dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\n",
    "# Stage 1: Build environment with full toolchain\n",
    "FROM golang:1.21 AS builder\n",
    "WORKDIR /build\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install build dependencies\n",
    "RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git build-essential\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cache dependency downloads\n",
    "COPY go.mod go.sum ./\n",
    "RUN go mod download\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build the application\n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o app ./cmd/server\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stage 2: Minimal runtime\n",
    "FROM gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy only the compiled binary\n",
    "COPY --from=builder /build/app /app/\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy CA certificates for HTTPS\n",
    "COPY --from=builder /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/\n",
    "\n",
    "USER nonroot:nonroot\n",
    "EXPOSE 8080\n",
    "ENTRYPOINT [\"/app/app\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size Impact:**\n",
    "- Single stage with Go toolchain: ~1.2GB\n",
    "- Multi-stage with distroless: ~25MB (98% reduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Named Stages and Parallel Builds\n",
    "\n",
    "Name stages for clarity and potential parallelization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\n",
    "FROM node:20-alpine AS dependencies\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "COPY package*.json ./\n",
    "RUN npm ci --only=production\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM node:20-alpine AS development\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "COPY --from=dependencies /app/node_modules ./node_modules\n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "CMD [\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM node:20-alpine AS production\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "COPY --from=dependencies /app/node_modules ./node_modules\n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "RUN npm run build\n",
    "RUN npm prune --production\n",
    "USER node\n",
    "CMD [\"node\", \"dist/index.js\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Build specific targets:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Build only development stage\n",
    "docker build --target development -t myapp:dev .\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build only production\n",
    "docker build --target production -t myapp:prod .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cross-Stage Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Access files from any previous stage, not just immediately preceding:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM node:20-alpine AS builder\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "RUN npm ci && npm run build\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM nginx:alpine AS assets\n",
    "COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM builder AS test-runner\n",
    "RUN npm test\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM assets AS production\n",
    "# Only assets make it here, test artifacts excluded\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Security Isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Use multi-stage builds to handle secrets without leaving them in layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# Stage with SSH key for private repo access\n",
    "FROM alpine AS git-clone\n",
    "RUN apk add --no-cache git openssh-client\n",
    "COPY id_rsa /root/.ssh/id_rsa\n",
    "RUN chmod 600 /root/.ssh/id_rsa\n",
    "RUN git clone git@github.com:private/repo.git /src\n",
    "\n",
    "# Final stage - no SSH key\n",
    "FROM nginx:alpine\n",
    "COPY --from=git-clone /src/static /usr/share/nginx/html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** Multi-stage builds are the **primary optimization technique** for production images. They eliminate build tools, source code, and secrets from final artifacts, reducing attack surface and image size by orders of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 Build Cache Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker's layer cache dramatically accelerates rebuilds, but naive Dockerfile ordering invalidates caches unnecessarily. Strategic ordering ensures expensive operations (dependency installation) reuse cache while cheap operations (code changes) invalidate only final layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cache Invalidation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "A layer is rebuilt if:\n",
    "- The Dockerfile instruction changes\n",
    "- The files referenced by `COPY` or `ADD` change (checksum comparison)\n",
    "- Any previous layer was rebuilt\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Golden Rule:** Order from least-changing to most-changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# BAD - Changes to source invalidate dependency layer\n",
    "COPY . /app\n",
    "RUN npm install\n",
    "\n",
    "# GOOD - Dependencies cached unless package.json changes\n",
    "COPY package*.json /app/\n",
    "RUN npm install\n",
    "COPY . /app\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependency Cache Mounts (BuildKit)\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern Docker with BuildKit supports cache mounts that persist between builds without creating layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\n",
    "FROM python:3.11-slim\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mount cache directory for pip\n",
    "RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \\\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Cache persists across `docker build` invocations\n",
    "- Not included in final image layers\n",
    "- Shared between parallel builds\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Apt/Apk Cache Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed up package installation in CI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\n",
    "FROM ubuntu:22.04\n",
    "RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt,sharing=locked \\\n",
    "    --mount=type=cache,target=/var/lib/apt,sharing=locked \\\n",
    "    apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n",
    "    build-essential \\\n",
    "    libpq-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cache Invalidation Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version Pinning with Cache Busting:**\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "ARG DEPENDENCIES_VERSION=1.0\n",
    "COPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt\n",
    "RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip,id=pip-${DEPENDENCIES_VERSION} \\\n",
    "    pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Force cache invalidation by changing the ARG:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker build --build-arg DEPENDENCIES_VERSION=1.1 .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layer Size Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify large layers slowing builds:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Show layer sizes\n",
    "docker history myimage:latest\n",
    "\n",
    "# Detailed analysis with dive tool\n",
    "dive myimage:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization targets:**\n",
    "- Keep dependency layers under 500MB\n",
    "- Minimize RUN commands that produce large temporary files\n",
    "- Clean up package managers in same layer as install\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** Build cache optimization reduces CI/CD pipeline times from minutes to seconds. Structure Dockerfiles to maximize cache hits on expensive operations, and use BuildKit cache mounts for package managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.3 BuildKit Features\n",
    "\n",
    "BuildKit is Docker's modern builder with advanced features for security, performance, and flexibility. Enable it with `export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` or configure in daemon.json.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Remove secret file\n",
    "rm npmrc\n",
    "```\n",

    "FROM alpine AS builder\n",
    "RUN apk add --no-cache git openssh-client\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mount SSH agent socket\n",
    "RUN --mount=type=ssh git clone git@github.com:private/repo.git /src\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM scratch\n",
    "COPY --from=builder /src/app /app\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Build command:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "eval $(ssh-agent -s)\n",
    "ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n",
    "\n",
    "docker buildx build --ssh default=${SSH_AUTH_SOCK} -t myapp:latest .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bind Mounts During Build\n",
    "\n",
    "Access host files without COPY (useful for large files):\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\n",
    "FROM python:3.11\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mount source code read-only instead of COPY\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**All three stages (lint, test, build) execute simultaneously** on multi-core systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** BuildKit transforms Docker from a simple layer builder into a sophisticated build system. Secret mounts eliminate credential leakage, SSH forwarding enables private repository access, and parallel execution maximizes hardware utilization.\n",

    "### 8.4 Custom Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "While basic container networking suffices for simple cases, production applications require custom network topologies, static IPs, and cross-container communication patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User-Defined Bridge Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Create isolated networks with custom DNS and IPAM:\n",

    "#### Macvlan Networks (Production Parity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Attach containers directly to physical network (gets real IP):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create macvlan network\n",
    "docker network create -d macvlan \\\n",

    "### 8.5 Volume Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond basic persistence, Docker supports advanced volume drivers, volume pre-population, and performance optimization.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Use in container\n",
    "docker run -v nfs-volume:/data myapp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Volume Initialization Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Populate volumes on first run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM alpine AS builder\n",
    "RUN mkdir /data && echo \"initial config\" > /data/config.conf\n",

    "VOLUME /data\n",
    "COPY --from=builder /data/config.conf /data/\n",
    "CMD [\"cat\", \"/data/config.conf\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** `VOLUME` in Dockerfile creates an anonymous volume if not mapped, but content in image at that path is copied to volume on first run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### tmpfs Mounts\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory storage for sensitive or temporary data:\n",
    "\n",

    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM ubuntu\n",
    "CMD sleep 1000\n",
    "```\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -d --name test myimage\n",
    "docker stop test  # Takes 10 seconds (SIGTERM ignored, then SIGKILL)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Use Exec Form (JSON array):**\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "CMD [\"sleep\", \"1000\"]  # sleep is PID 1, handles signals\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Use tini (init system):**\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM node:20-alpine\n",
    "RUN apk add --no-cache tini\n",
    "ENTRYPOINT [\"/sbin/tini\", \"--\"]\n",
    "CMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Use --init flag:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run --init myapp  # Injects tini automatically\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Signal handling in application code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Node.js example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "process.on('SIGTERM', () => {\n",
    "  console.log('SIGTERM received, shutting down gracefully');\n",
    "  server.close(() => {\n",
    "    process.exit(0);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Go example:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)\n",
    "signal.Notify(sigChan, syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGINT)\n",
    "\n",
    "go func() {\n",
    "  <-sigChan\n",
    "  log.Println(\"Shutting down gracefully...\")\n",
    "  srv.Shutdown(context.Background())\n",
    "}()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graceful Shutdown Timeout\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker waits 10 seconds (configurable) before SIGKILL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Increase timeout for slow cleanup\n",
    "docker stop -t 30 mycontainer\n",
    "docker kill -s SIGTERM mycontainer  # Custom signal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Compose:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  api:\n",
    "    stop_signal: SIGTERM\n",
    "    stop_grace_period: 30s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** Improper signal handling causes **abrupt terminations**, leading to corrupted data, dropped connections, and failed health checks. Always ensure PID 1 properly handles SIGTERM for graceful shutdowns.\n",

    "### Chapter Summary and Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you mastered production-grade containerization techniques. You implemented **multi-stage builds** to separate build tools from runtime artifacts, achieving 90%+ size reductions. You optimized **build caching** through strategic layer ordering and BuildKit cache mounts, dramatically accelerating CI pipelines. You leveraged **BuildKit secrets and SSH forwarding** to handle credentials securely without image contamination. You configured **custom networks and volumes** for complex topologies, enforced **resource limits** to prevent system exhaustion, ensured proper **signal handling** for graceful shutdowns, and applied **security hardening** including non-root users, read-only filesystems, and dropped capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques produce containers that are fast to build, small to transfer, secure to run, and reliable to terminate\u2014the exact standards required for Kubernetes orchestration. Your images are now ready for the distributed, dynamic environment of container clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Chapter 9: Docker Image Optimization**, we refine these techniques further with specific focus on size analysis, layer inspection, and performance benchmarking. You will learn to use tools like `dive` to visualize layer efficiency, implement `.dockerignore` patterns to minimize build context, and benchmark startup performance. This optimization chapter completes our Docker mastery before transitioning to **Part III: Kubernetes Fundamentals**, where these optimized images become the deployable units orchestrated across clusters."
