    "# Chapter 46: Debugging CI/CD Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous delivery pipelines are complex distributed systems that orchestrate code compilation, artifact creation, security scanning, and deployment across multiple environments. When these pipelines fail, the root cause may reside in application code, infrastructure configuration, network connectivity, resource constraints, or the pipeline definitions themselves. Debugging CI/CD pipelines requires distinct strategies from debugging applications: pipelines are ephemeral, execute in isolated environments, and often lack interactive debugging capabilities. Understanding how to extract diagnostic information from failed builds, reproduce failures locally, and trace execution across distributed systems is essential for maintaining reliable delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter establishes systematic approaches for diagnosing pipeline failures, from local container debugging to distributed tracing across Kubernetes clusters, ensuring rapid resolution when continuous delivery breaks down.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 46.1 Common Pipeline Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipeline failures manifest in distinct categories, each requiring specific diagnostic approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compilation Errors:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[ERROR] COMPILATION ERROR\n",
    "[ERROR] /src/main/java/com/company/PaymentService.java:[42,17] cannot find symbol\n",
    "  symbol:   method processPayment()\n",
    "  location: class com.company.PaymentService\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependency Resolution:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm ERR! code E404\n",
    "npm ERR! 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@company/private-pkg/-/private-pkg-1.0.0.tgz\n",
    "npm ERR! 404 '@company/private-pkg@1.0.0' is not in this registry.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Build failures are typically deterministic\u2014the same code produces the same failure. Check for:\n",
    "- Missing imports or dependencies\n",
    "- Version conflicts (transitive dependency upgrades)\n",
    "- Environment differences (JDK version, Node version)\n",
    "- Private registry authentication failures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flaky Tests:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Test PaymentServiceTest.shouldProcessPayment: FAILED\n",
    "Expected: COMPLETED\n",
    "Actual: PENDING\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timeout Failures:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Test execution timed out after 300 seconds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Flaky tests pass and fail inconsistently, often due to:\n",
    "- Race conditions in async code\n",
    "- External service dependencies\n",
    "- Time-sensitive assertions\n",
    "- Shared state between tests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# retry flaky tests\n",
    "test:\n",
    "  script: ./mvnw test\n",
    "  retry:\n",
    "    max: 2\n",
    "    when: runner_system_failure\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Pull Errors:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Failed to pull image \"payment-service:v2.1.0\": \n",
    "rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: \n",
    "pull access denied for payment-service, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crash Loop Backoffs:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Back-off restarting failed container\n",
    "Error: container create failed: time=\"2024-01-15T10:00:00Z\" level=error msg=\"container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: exec: \\\"./start.sh\\\": permission denied\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 46.2 Container Debugging Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker Exec\n",
    "\n",
    "Access running containers for interactive debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Shell into running container\n",
    "docker exec -it payment-pod-abc123 /bin/sh\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check process status\n",
    "docker exec payment-pod-abc123 ps aux\n",
    "\n",
    "# View environment variables\n",
    "docker exec payment-pod-abc123 env\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy files from container to host for analysis\n",
    "docker cp payment-pod-abc123:/var/log/app.log ./local-app.log\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run specific debugging commands\n",
    "docker exec payment-pod-abc123 java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The `docker exec` command runs a new process in an existing container's namespaces. The `-it` flags allocate a pseudo-TTY and keep stdin open for interactive shells. This is useful for checking file system state, running diagnostic commands, or inspecting running processes without stopping the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debug Containers (Distroless)\n",
    "\n",
    "Distroless images lack shells, requiring special debugging techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Copy debugging tools into distroless container\n",
    "kubectl debug payment-pod-abc123 \\\n",
    "  --image=busybox:1.36 \\\n",
    "  --target=payment-service \\\n",
    "  -- /bin/sh\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or use ephemeral containers (Kubernetes 1.23+)\n",
    "kubectl alpha debug -it payment-pod-abc123 \\\n",
    "  --image=nicolaka/netshoot \\\n",
    "  -- /bin/bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debug Container Configuration:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: v1\n",
    "kind: Pod\n",
    "metadata:\n",
    "  name: payment-service\n",
    "spec:\n",
    "  containers:\n",
    "    - name: payment-service\n",
    "      image: gcr.io/distroless/java17-debian12\n",
    "      securityContext:\n",
    "        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false\n",
    "        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true\n",
    "    # Debug sidecar (always present but scaled to 0 in production)\n",
    "    - name: debug\n",
    "      image: busybox:1.36\n",
    "      command: [\"sleep\", \"infinity\"]\n",
    "      resources:\n",
    "        limits:\n",
    "          cpu: \"0\"\n",
    "          memory: \"0\"\n",
    "      lifecycle:\n",
    "        postStart:\n",
    "          exec:\n",
    "            command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"echo 'Debug container ready'\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Distroless images (Google's gcr.io/distroless) contain only the application and runtime, no shell, package manager, or utilities. The `kubectl debug` command creates an ephemeral container sharing the target container's namespaces (PID, network, IPC), allowing debugging tools to inspect the target process. The `nicolaka/netshoot` image contains network debugging tools (tcpdump, netstat, curl).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ephemeral Debug Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes 1.25+ supports ephemeral containers for debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Add ephemeral container to running pod\n",
    "kubectl debug payment-pod-abc123 \\\n",
    "  -it \\\n",
    "  --image=busybox \\\n",
    "  -- /bin/sh\n",
    "\n",
    "# Debug specific container in multi-container pod\n",
    "kubectl debug payment-pod-abc123 \\\n",
    "  -it \\\n",
    "  --container=payment-service \\\n",
    "  --image=nicolaka/netshoot \\\n",
    "  -- /bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy files using ephemeral container\n",
    "kubectl debug payment-pod-abc123 \\\n",
    "  --image=busybox \\\n",
    "  -- /bin/sh -c \"cat /proc/1/root/app/config/application.yml\" > /tmp/config.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Ephemeral containers are temporary containers added to existing pods without modifying the pod spec. They share the target container's namespaces, enabling inspection of filesystems (via `/proc/1/root/`), network stacks, and process tables. They disappear when the debugging session ends, leaving no permanent footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 46.3 Kubernetes Pod Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crash Loop Backoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagnosing Crash Loops:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check pod status and restart count\n",
    "kubectl get pods -n production\n",
    "# NAME              READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE\n",
    "# payment-pod       0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   5          10m\n",
    "\n",
    "# View logs from previous (crashed) container\n",
    "kubectl logs payment-pod -n production --previous\n",
    "\n",
    "# Describe pod for events\n",
    "kubectl describe pod payment-pod -n production\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Causes and Fixes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Missing Start Command:**\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# Bad - no CMD or ENTRYPOINT\n",
    "FROM openjdk:17\n",
    "COPY target/app.jar /app.jar\n",
    "\n",
    "# Good\n",
    "FROM openjdk:17\n",
    "COPY target/app.jar /app.jar\n",
    "ENTRYPOINT [\"java\", \"-jar\", \"/app.jar\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Permission Denied:**\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# Fix executable permissions\n",
    "RUN chmod +x /app/start.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or in Kubernetes\n",
    "securityContext:\n",
    "  runAsUser: 1000\n",
    "  runAsGroup: 1000\n",
    "  fsGroup: 1000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Resource Limits:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "resources:\n",
    "  requests:\n",
    "    memory: \"512Mi\"\n",
    "    cpu: \"250m\"\n",
    "  limits:\n",
    "    memory: \"1Gi\"  # Increase if OOMKilled\n",
    "    cpu: \"1000m\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Liveness Probe Too Aggressive:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "livenessProbe:\n",
    "  httpGet:\n",
    "    path: /actuator/health\n",
    "    port: 8080\n",
    "  initialDelaySeconds: 60  # Increase for slow-starting apps\n",
    "  periodSeconds: 10\n",
    "  failureThreshold: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Pull Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authentication Issues:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Verify image exists\n",
    "docker pull ghcr.io/company/payment-service:v2.1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check Kubernetes pull secrets\n",
    "kubectl get secret regcred -n production -o jsonpath='{.data.\\.dockerconfigjson}' | base64 -d\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create registry secret\n",
    "kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \\\n",
    "  --docker-server=ghcr.io \\\n",
    "  --docker-username=$GITHUB_USER \\\n",
    "  --docker-password=$GITHUB_TOKEN \\\n",
    "  --namespace=production\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Tag Issues:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check available tags\n",
    "crane ls ghcr.io/company/payment-service | grep v2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify digest matches\n",
    "docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/company/payment-service:v2.1.0 --verbose\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "`crane` (Google's container tool) lists tags without pulling. Image pull errors often indicate:\n",
    "- Typo in tag name\n",
    "- Image not pushed to registry\n",
    "- Registry authentication expired\n",
    "- Network policies blocking registry access\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resource Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Out of Memory (OOMKilled):**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check pod status\n",
    "kubectl get pod payment-pod -o jsonpath='{.status.containerStatuses[0].lastState.terminated}'\n",
    "\n",
    "# View events\n",
    "kubectl get events --field-selector reason=OOMKilled\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check memory usage trends\n",
    "kubectl top pod payment-pod -n production\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Debugging:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# Enable JVM OOM heap dump\n",
    "env:\n",
    "  - name: JAVA_OPTS\n",
    "    value: \"-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/dumps\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "volumeMounts:\n",
    "  - name: dumps\n",
    "    mountPath: /dumps\n",
    "\n",
    "volumes:\n",
    "  - name: dumps\n",
    "    emptyDir:\n",
    "      sizeLimit: 2Gi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "When containers exceed memory limits, Kubernetes sends SIGKILL (OOMKilled). The JVM flags above create heap dumps before death, which can be copied out for analysis with `kubectl cp` or Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT).\n",
    "\n",
    "**CPU Throttling:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check CPU throttling\n",
    "kubectl get pod payment-pod -o jsonpath='{.status.containerStatuses[0].resources}'\n",
    "\n",
    "# View metrics\n",
    "kubectl top pod payment-pod --containers\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check cgroup limits inside container\n",
    "docker exec payment-pod cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us\n",
    "docker exec payment-pod cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "If `cpu.cfs_quota_us` (100000 = 100ms) equals `cpu.cfs_period_us` (100000), the container has full CPU. If quota is less than period, the container is throttled. Increase CPU limits if throttling causes latency spikes.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Verify pods have matching labels\n",
    "kubectl get pods -l app=payment-service,version=v2.1.0 -n production\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Services route traffic to Pods via label selectors. If `kubectl get endpoints` returns empty, no Pods match the selector. Check for:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "`readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` prevents writing to container image layers. Applications must write to mounted volumes (`emptyDir`, `persistentVolumeClaim`) or ephemeral storage. This prevents attackers from modifying binaries but requires apps to be configured for non-root execution and writable temp directories.\n",

    "## Chapter Summary and Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter established systematic debugging strategies for CI/CD pipelines, addressing the unique challenges of ephemeral build environments and distributed execution. We examined container debugging techniques including `docker exec` for running containers, ephemeral debug containers for distroless images, and `kubectl debug` for Kubernetes pods without modifying specifications. Kubernetes troubleshooting covered crash loop backoff diagnosis through log analysis and pod events, image pull error resolution via registry authentication verification and tag existence checking, and resource constraint debugging using cgroup inspection and memory dump analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network debugging strategies included DNS resolution verification using `nslookup` and CoreDNS log analysis, service connectivity testing via port forwarding and endpoint validation, and network policy troubleshooting through temporary allow-all policies. Permission debugging focused on RBAC verification using `kubectl auth can-i`, service account token validation, and security context configuration for read-only root filesystems. Advanced tools like Stern for multi-pod log tailing, K9s for interactive cluster exploration, and Inspektor Gadget for eBPF-based kernel tracing provide deep visibility into running systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Build reproducibility techniques ensure CI failures can be reproduced locally using Docker BuildKit with resource constraints and Act for GitHub Actions simulation. Pipeline observability extends distributed tracing concepts to CI/CD, enabling correlation between pipeline stages and visualization of build duration trends alongside application metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Use `kubectl debug` with ephemeral containers to inspect distroless images without modifying Dockerfiles or pod specs; the debug container shares namespaces with the target container while providing debugging tools.\n",
    "- When diagnosing CrashLoopBackOff, always check `--previous` logs for the actual error, verify resource limits aren't causing OOMKilled, and ensure executable permissions on scripts.\n",
    "- For ImagePullBackOff errors, verify image tags exist using `crane ls` or `docker manifest inspect`, check `imagePullSecrets` are correctly attached to service accounts, and ensure registries are accessible from cluster nodes.\n",
    "- Debug DNS issues using `nslookup` from within pods, verify CoreDNS is running, and check that search domains in `/etc/resolv.conf` include the correct namespace.\n",
    "- Use `kubectl auth can-i` to verify RBAC permissions for service accounts, and remember that pods must be recreated to pick up new service account tokens after RBAC changes.\n",
    "- Implement pipeline observability by pushing metrics to Prometheus Pushgateway or emitting OpenTelemetry spans from CI jobs, enabling correlation between deployment frequency and application reliability metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Chapter Preview:**\n",
    "Chapter 47: Pipeline Performance Optimization addresses the efficiency and speed of continuous delivery pipelines. We will examine strategies for reducing build times through intelligent caching, parallel execution, and incremental builds. The chapter covers Docker layer caching optimization, dependency resolution acceleration, test parallelization strategies, and resource right-sizing for CI runners. We will explore network optimization for distributed builds, artifact management strategies to reduce transfer times, and cost optimization techniques for cloud-based CI/CD platforms, ensuring that fast feedback loops support rather than hinder developer velocity."
