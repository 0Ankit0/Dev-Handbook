    "## Introduction: The New Frontier of Computational Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 13, we secured infrastructure where code was deterministic\u2014where every instruction was explicitly written, reviewed, and version-controlled. We now enter a paradigm where systems execute logic that is partially *learned* rather than programmed, where applications make autonomous decisions based on probabilistic patterns extracted from vast training corpora, and where agents can chain together actions across disparate systems without human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems represent a fundamental shift in the attack surface. Traditional vulnerabilities exploit deterministic logic flaws\u2014buffer overflows, SQL injections, or misconfigurations. AI systems introduce *stochastic* vulnerabilities: prompt injection attacks that bypass safety guardrails by manipulating the statistical likelihood of token generation, training data poisoning that subtly alters model behavior at the foundational level, and agentic hijacking that weaponizes an AI's capabilities against its operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agentic AI**\u2014systems capable of autonomous planning, tool use, and multi-step reasoning\u2014introduces unique risks. Unlike simple chatbots, agentic systems can execute code, query databases, send emails, or provision infrastructure. When compromised, they become intelligent adversaries operating within your environment with legitimate credentials and context.\n",

    "This chapter navigates the **MITRE ATLAS** framework (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) and the **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications** alongside the emerging **OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI Applications (2026)**. We will explore how to secure the AI supply chain from poisoned models, implement privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy and federated learning, and establish governance frameworks compliant with **ISO/IEC 42001:2023**\u2014the international standard for AI management systems.\n",

    "## 14.1 Understanding AI/ML Security Risks: The MITRE ATLAS Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Before defending AI systems, we must understand how adversaries attack them. **MITRE ATLAS** (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) is a globally accessible, living knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world attack observations and realistic demonstrations from AI red teams and security groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional cybersecurity frameworks that focus on networks or applications, ATLAS maps the specific lifecycle of AI systems: from data collection and model training to deployment and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The AI System Lifecycle and Attack Surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "An AI system progresses through distinct stages, each with unique vulnerabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection & Processing**: Training data poisoning, label manipulation\n",
    "2. **Model Training**: Gradient inversion, backdoor insertion, hyperparameter tampering\n",
    "3. **Model Storage & Supply Chain**: Model serialization attacks, weight tampering, malicious pre-trained models\n",
    "4. **Inference/Deployment**: Prompt injection, model extraction, evasion attacks (adversarial examples)\n",
    "5. **Agentic Action**: Tool misuse, privilege escalation through autonomous chains\n",
    "\n",
    "### MITRE ATLAS Tactics Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "ATLAS organizes adversary behavior into tactics (the \"why\") and techniques (the \"how\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tactic | Description | Example Techniques |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Reconnaissance** | Gathering information about AI systems | Search for publicly available research, probe ML model |\n",
    "| **Resource Development** | Establishing resources for attack | Acquire public ML artifacts, develop ML capabilities |\n",
    "| **Initial Access** | Gaining initial foothold | Evade ML model, exploit public-facing application |\n",
    "| **ML Model Access** | Gaining access to the model itself | Inference API access, physical environment access |\n",
    "| **Execution** | Running adversarial ML code | Craft adversarial data, exploit software dependencies |\n",
    "| **Persistence** | Maintaining access | Backdoor ML model, poison training data |\n",
    "| **Defense Evasion** | Avoiding detection | Evade ML-based detection, obfuscate adversarial data |\n",
    "| **Discovery** | Understanding the system | Analyze system logs, probe model architecture |\n",
    "| **Collection** | Gathering targeted data | ML inference metadata, training data extraction |\n",
    "| **ML Attack Staging** | Preparing the attack | Create proxy model, craft adversarial data |\n",
    "| **Exfiltration** | Stealing data | Exfiltrate data via ML inference, steal ML model |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adversarial Machine Learning Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evasion Attacks (Inference-time)**: The attacker modifies input data to cause misclassification without changing the model. For example, adding specific pixel patterns to an image to bypass facial recognition, or crafting prompts that bypass content filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poisoning Attacks (Training-time)**: The attacker contaminates training data to insert backdoors or degrade model performance. A compromised dataset might teach a sentiment analysis model to classify specific trigger phrases as positive regardless of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Extraction**: Querying an API model extensively to create a functional copy (shadow model), stealing intellectual property and potentially exposing sensitive training data embedded in model weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Inversion**: Reconstructing training data from model outputs. If a facial recognition model is overfitted, an attacker might reconstruct images of specific individuals by querying the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Membership Inference**: Determining whether a specific data record was part of the training set, posing privacy risks for sensitive medical or financial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defense Strategies from ATLAS\n",

    "We distinguished between traditional **LLM vulnerabilities** (prompt injection, insecure output handling) and the specific risks of **Agentic AI** (ASI01-ASI05). You implemented defense mechanisms against **Agent Behavior Hijacking**, ensuring autonomous systems cannot be redirected through malicious context; **Prompt Injection**, using strict input delimiters and instruction hierarchies; **Tool Misuse**, sandboxing execution environments; **Identity Abuse**, enforcing attribute-based access controls; and **Inadequate Guardrails**, implementing resource constraints and output sanitization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **AI Supply Chain** emerged as a critical concern. You learned to replace dangerous serialization formats like Pickle with **SafeTensors**, validate dataset integrity through cryptographic provenance, and implement model signing to verify weight authenticity before deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy-preserving techniques opened possibilities for secure collaborative AI. **Differential Privacy** provided mathematical guarantees against membership inference through gradient noise addition, while **Federated Learning** enabled distributed training without centralizing sensitive data. These techniques, combined with homomorphic encryption for encrypted inference, form the foundation of privacy-by-design AI architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** provided the governance framework necessary for organizational AI risk management. You explored how to implement AI Management Systems (AIMS) with proper risk assessment methodologies, lifecycle controls, and continuous monitoring for drift and adversarial patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, securing AI systems in isolation is insufficient. These models and agents must be integrated into production environments, fed by data pipelines, deployed via CI/CD systems, and monitored alongside traditional applications. The intersection of AI security and DevOps\u2014**DevSecOps for AI**\u2014requires automated security testing, model versioning, and continuous validation of AI behavior against safety constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Chapter 15: DevSecOps & Automation**, we will operationalize these security controls, integrating AI model scanning, bias detection, and adversarial testing into continuous integration pipelines. You will learn to implement **Security as Code** for AI infrastructure, automate the validation of model cards and data sheets, and build **MLOps** pipelines that maintain the security, privacy, and governance standards established in this chapter while enabling rapid, reliable AI deployment at scale."
