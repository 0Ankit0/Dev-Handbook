    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 What is a Time-Series Prediction System?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A time-series prediction system is a specialized computational framework designed to analyze historical data collected over time and generate forecasts about future values. Unlike traditional machine learning problems where data points are assumed to be independent, time-series data has an inherent temporal ordering where each observation is related to its predecessors and successors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Understanding the Core Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "At its heart, a time-series prediction system answers a fundamental question: *\"Given what has happened in the past, what is likely to happen in the future?\"* This question manifests differently across domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Finance**: \"Given the historical stock prices, what will the price be tomorrow?\"\n",
    "- **Retail**: \"Given past sales data, how much inventory should we stock next month?\"\n",
    "- **Weather**: \"Given temperature readings over the past week, what will the temperature be this weekend?\"\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: \"Given a patient's vital signs over time, will their condition deteriorate?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The NEPSE Example Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's ground this concept with our running example throughout this handbook: the **Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE)** prediction system. NEPSE is the primary stock exchange of Nepal, and predicting its movements involves analyzing historical trading data to forecast future price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a sample from our NEPSE dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "S.No,Symbol,Conf.,Open,High,Low,Close,LTP,Close - LTP,Close - LTP %,VWAP,Vol,Prev. Close,Turnover,Trans.,Diff,Range,Diff %,Range %,VWAP %,52 Weeks High,52 Weeks Low\n",
    "1,ABL,Standard,580.00,590.00,575.00,588.00,588.00,0.00,0.00,584.50,15230,580.00,8900000,285,8.00,15.00,1.38,2.59,0.77,650.00,420.00\n",
    "2,ADBL,Standard,620.00,635.00,615.00,630.00,630.00,0.00,0.00,626.80,8500,618.00,5330000,152,12.00,20.00,1.94,3.24,1.42,720.00,450.00\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row represents a single trading day for a specific stock symbol. The temporal aspect comes from the sequence of these daily records—today's closing price is influenced by yesterday's closing price, the trading volume, market sentiment, and numerous other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Characteristics of Time-Series Prediction Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Temporal Dependence**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most defining characteristic is that observations are not independent. In our NEPSE example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This illustrates temporal dependence\n",
    "# Today's close price depends on previous days' prices\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load NEPSE data\n",
    "nepse_data = pd.read_csv('nepse_data.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# For a single stock, let's examine the relationship\n",
    "stock_data = nepse_data[nepse_data['Symbol'] == 'ABL'].copy()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the correlation between consecutive close prices\n",
    "# This demonstrates temporal dependence\n",
    "stock_data['Prev_Close'] = stock_data['Close'].shift(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate correlation between today's close and yesterday's close\n",
    "correlation = stock_data['Close'].corr(stock_data['Prev_Close'])\n",
    "print(f\"Correlation between consecutive close prices: {correlation:.4f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Explanation**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Correlation between consecutive close prices: 0.9987\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The extremely high correlation (close to 1.0) confirms that consecutive daily closing prices are highly dependent on each other. This is the essence of temporal dependence—if yesterday's price is 588, today's price is very likely to be close to 588, not suddenly jump to 300 or 900 without significant market events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Sequential Nature**\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-series data must maintain its order. Shuffling the data destroys critical information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Demonstrating why order matters in time-series\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a simple visualization showing the difference\n",
    "fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 5))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Original ordered data\n",
    "axes[0].plot(stock_data['Close'].values[:50], marker='o', markersize=3)\n",
    "axes[0].set_title('Original Ordered Time-Series\\n(Shows Trends and Patterns)')\n",
    "axes[0].set_xlabel('Time Index (Days)')\n",
    "axes[0].set_ylabel('Close Price (NPR)')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Shuffled data - temporal information destroyed\n",
    "shuffled = stock_data['Close'].values[:50].copy()\n",
    "np.random.shuffle(shuffled)\n",
    "axes[1].plot(shuffled, marker='o', markersize=3, color='orange')\n",
    "axes[1].set_title('Shuffled Time-Series\\n(Trends and Patterns Destroyed)')\n",
    "axes[1].set_xlabel('Random Index (Meaningless)')\n",
    "axes[1].set_ylabel('Close Price (NPR)')\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.tight_layout()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Explanation**:\n",
    "The left plot shows the natural progression of stock prices over 50 days—you can observe trends, potential reversals, and the natural ebb and flow of the market. The right plot shows the same data shuffled randomly—the temporal patterns are completely destroyed, making any meaningful prediction impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Time-Based Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-series data often exhibits patterns that repeat or evolve over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trends**: Long-term upward or downward movement\n",
    "- **Seasonality**: Regular, predictable patterns (e.g., higher trading volumes during earnings season)\n",
    "- **Cyclicality**: Longer-term fluctuations without fixed periods\n",
    "- **Irregularity**: Random, unpredictable variations\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Identifying basic patterns in NEPSE data\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Purpose**: This function takes raw stock data and performs basic pattern analysis, which is a fundamental first step in any time-series prediction system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parameter Breakdown**:\n",
    "   - `data`: The full dataset containing all stocks\n",
    "   - `symbol`: The specific stock we want to analyze (like 'ABL' for Agriculture Development Bank)\n",
    "   - `column`: Which price metric to focus on (Open, High, Low, Close, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trend Analysis Logic**:\n",
    "   - We split the data into two halves\n",
    "   - Compare the average price in the first half vs. second half\n",
    "   - If the second half average is higher, the trend is upward\n",
    "   - The magnitude tells us how significant the trend is\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rolling Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "   - This measures how much prices typically deviate from the mean over a 20-day window\n",
    "   - Higher values indicate more volatile periods\n",
    "   - This is crucial for risk assessment in prediction systems\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Class Structure**: We define a class `NEPSEPricePredictor` that encapsulates all prediction-related functionality. This follows object-oriented design principles and makes the code modular and reusable.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - This is the constructor that runs when we create a new instance of the predictor\n",
    "   - It loads the CSV data using pandas\n",
    "   - Calls `prepare_data()` to ensure data is ready for analysis\n",
    "   - The `self` keyword refers to the current instance, allowing us to store data that persists across method calls\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`prepare_data` Method**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Ensures data quality before any analysis begins\n",
    "   - **Information Display**: Shows total records, unique stocks, and available columns\n",
    "   - **Missing Value Check**: Uses `isnull().sum()` to count null values per column\n",
    "   - **Sample Data**: Displays first 5 records to give a quick visual verification\n",
    "   - **Statistical Summary**: Provides count, mean, std, min, quartiles, and max for numeric columns\n",

    "**Detailed Code Walkthrough**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Creation (`create_features` method)**:\n",
    "   - **Lag Features**: We create `Close_Lag_1`, `Close_Lag_2`, etc., which represent the closing prices from 1, 2, 3... days ago. These are crucial because stock prices exhibit momentum—yesterday's price heavily influences today's.\n",
    "   - **Momentum Features**: The difference between current price and prices from 1 or 5 days ago captures the direction and strength of price movement.\n",
    "   - **Volatility Feature**: Rolling standard deviation over 5 days measures how unstable the price has been recently—high volatility often precedes significant moves.\n",
    "   - **Volume Features**: Trading volume is a leading indicator; unusual volume often signals impending price moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Process (`train` method)**:\n",
    "   - **Time-Series Split**: Unlike typical ML problems where we shuffle data randomly, time-series requires chronological splitting. We train on past data to predict future data.\n",
    "   - **Linear Regression**: The simplest model—we'll explore more sophisticated models in later chapters.\n",
    "   - **Metrics Calculation**: MAE (Mean Absolute Error) gives average error in NPR; RMSE penalizes large errors more; R² measures how well the model explains variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Analysis (`analyze_predictions` method)**:\n",
    "   - Shows how close predictions are to actual values\n",
    "   - Percentage-based thresholds are intuitive for financial data\n",

    "This comprehensive pipeline demonstrates every critical step in building a time-series prediction system. Let me explain each component in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 - Data Validation**:\n",
    "- Verifies that all required columns exist\n",
    "- Checks for basic data integrity\n",
    "- Reports on data volume and uniqueness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 - Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "- **Duplicate Removal**: Ensures each record is unique\n",
    "- **Missing Value Handling**: Uses forward-fill for prices (appropriate for time-series)\n",
    "- **Price Validation**: Ensures High ≥ Low, High ≥ Open, etc.\n",
    "- **Chronological Sorting**: Critical for time-series analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 - Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "- **Lag Features**: Capture autocorrelation (relationship with past values)\n",
    "- **Rolling Windows**: Capture trends and volatility over time\n",
    "- **Price-Based Features**: Capture intra-day patterns\n",
    "- **Momentum Features**: Capture rate of change and relative position\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4 - Data Splitting**:\n",
    "- Uses chronological split (not random!)\n",
    "- Creates separate train/validation/test sets\n",
    "- Explains why shuffling is wrong for time-series\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5 - Feature Scaling**:\n",
    "- Standardizes features to mean=0, std=1\n",
    "- Fits scaler on training data only (prevents leakage)\n",
    "- Applies same transformation to all sets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6 - Model Training**:\n",
    "- Selects appropriate model\n",
    "- Trains on training data\n",
    "- Validates on validation data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7 - Model Evaluation**:\n",
    "- Tests on held-out test data\n",
    "- Calculates multiple metrics\n",
    "- Reports direction accuracy (important for trading)\n",
