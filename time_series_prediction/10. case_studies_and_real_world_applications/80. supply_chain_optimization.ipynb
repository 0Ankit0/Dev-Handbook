    "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the core components of supply chain optimization: demand forecasting, inventory management, and lead time prediction.\n",
    "- Identify the different types of data required for supply chain modeling (sales, orders, shipments, inventory levels, supplier information).\n",
    "- Engineer features that capture seasonality, trends, promotions, and external factors affecting demand.\n",
    "- Build and evaluate models for demand forecasting at multiple levels (SKU, store, warehouse).\n",
    "- Implement inventory optimization models (e.g., reorder point, safety stock) using forecast uncertainty.\n",
    "- Predict lead times using historical shipment data and external factors (e.g., port congestion, weather).\n",
    "- Design a multi‑echelon inventory system that optimizes stock across warehouses and retail locations.\n",
    "- Integrate forecasting and optimization into a production pipeline with monitoring and alerting.\n",

    "## **80.1 Introduction to Supply Chain Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Supply chain optimization aims to ensure that the right products are available at the right places, at the right times, and in the right quantities – while minimizing costs. It is a complex, multi‑faceted problem that involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demand forecasting**: Predicting future customer demand at various levels (SKU, category, store, region).\n",
    "- **Inventory optimization**: Determining optimal stock levels to meet demand while avoiding overstock and stockouts.\n",
    "- **Lead time prediction**: Estimating how long it will take for orders to arrive from suppliers.\n",
    "- **Replenishment planning**: Deciding when and how much to order.\n",
    "- **Network design**: Structuring warehouses and distribution centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning plays a crucial role in modern supply chains. Accurate demand forecasts reduce waste and improve service levels. Predictive models for lead times help manage uncertainty. Optimization algorithms balance trade‑offs between holding costs and stockout costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will build a simplified supply chain optimization system. We'll use synthetic data that mimics a retail chain with multiple products, warehouses, and stores. We'll integrate demand forecasting (building on Chapter 75), lead time prediction, and inventory optimization into a cohesive pipeline.\n",

    "## **80.2 Supply Chain Data Characteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Supply chain data typically includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sales data**: SKU, store, date, quantity sold, price, promotion flag.\n",
    "- **Inventory data**: Current stock levels, reorder points, safety stock, stockouts.\n",
    "- **Order data**: Purchase orders to suppliers, order dates, expected delivery dates, actual delivery dates.\n",
    "- **Shipment data**: Shipment ID, origin, destination, departure date, arrival date, carrier, mode (air, sea, land).\n",
    "- **Supplier data**: Supplier lead times, reliability, minimum order quantities.\n",
    "- **External data**: Holidays, weather, economic indicators, port congestion indices.\n",

    "4. **Data integration is challenging**: Supply chain data often resides in multiple systems (ERP, WMS, TMS). Building a unified data pipeline is a major effort.\n",
