    "## **Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the importance of documentation for long‑term maintainability and team collaboration.\n",
    "- Distinguish between different types of documentation: code documentation, API documentation, architecture documentation, user documentation, model documentation, and operational runbooks.\n",
    "- Write effective docstrings following standard formats (Google, NumPy, Sphinx).\n",
    "- Use tools like Sphinx, MkDocs, and Jupyter Book to generate professional documentation.\n",
    "- Document REST APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger, especially with FastAPI.\n",
    "- Create high‑level architecture diagrams and maintain them as code (C4 model, PlantUML).\n",
    "- Develop user guides and tutorials tailored to different audiences (e.g., traders, data scientists).\n",
    "- Produce model cards and data sheets to document ML models and datasets (as introduced in Chapter 77).\n",
    "- Write runbooks for incident response and operational tasks.\n",
    "- Maintain a team knowledge base (wiki) that evolves with the project.\n",
    "- Establish a documentation review process to ensure accuracy and freshness.\n",

    "## **89.1 Introduction to Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation is often the last thing on a developer's mind, but it is one of the most important investments a team can make. Good documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Onboards new team members faster** – they can understand the system without pinging colleagues.\n",
    "- **Reduces tribal knowledge** – prevents critical information from being locked in one person's head.\n",
    "- **Improves quality** – writing forces you to think through design decisions and edge cases.\n",
    "- **Enables users** – whether they are traders using the NEPSE predictions or other developers integrating with your API.\n",
    "- **Supports compliance** – in regulated industries, documentation is often a legal requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the NEPSE prediction system, documentation spans multiple audiences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Developers**: need to understand the code, architecture, and how to contribute.\n",
    "- **Data scientists**: need to know how features are computed, how models are trained, and how to reproduce experiments.\n",
    "- **Operations**: need runbooks for deployment, monitoring, and incident response.\n",
    "- **Business stakeholders**: need high‑level overviews and model performance reports.\n",
    "- **End users (traders)**: need to know how to interpret predictions and what the system can/cannot do.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will guide you through creating and maintaining documentation for each of these audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **89.2 Code Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Code documentation lives closest to the source. It includes comments, docstrings, and READMEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **89.2.1 Docstrings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every public module, class, function, and method should have a docstring. Docstrings should explain *what* the code does, not *how* (the code shows how). They should also document parameters, return values, and exceptions raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several popular docstring formats. We'll use the **Google style** for its readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_rsi(prices: pd.Series, period: int = 14) -> pd.Series:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Calculate the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for a price series.\n",
    "\n",
    "    RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price\n",
    "    movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100. Traditionally, RSI is considered\n",
    "    overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        prices (pd.Series): Series of closing prices.\n",
    "        period (int, optional): Lookback period for RSI calculation. Defaults to 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        pd.Series: RSI values with the same index as input, first `period` values NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Raises:\n",
    "        ValueError: If `prices` contains less than `period` non‑NaN values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        >>> prices = pd.Series([100, 105, 103, 108, 107, 110, 109, 112, 115, 113, 116, 118, 117, 119, 120])\n",
    "        >>> rsi = calculate_rsi(prices)\n",
    "        >>> rsi.iloc[-1]\n",
    "        65.23\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    if len(prices.dropna()) < period:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(f\"Need at least {period} non‑NaN values\")\n",
    "    # Implementation...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools**: Use `pydocstyle` to enforce docstring conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **89.2.2 Inline Comments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use comments sparingly, only to explain *why* a particular approach was taken, or to clarify complex logic. Avoid obvious comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# We use a while loop instead of recursion to avoid stack overflow on large datasets\n",
    "while idx < len(data):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **89.2.3 README Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every repository should have a `README.md` at the top level. It should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project title and brief description.\n",
    "- Badges (CI status, code coverage, license).\n",
    "- Quick start: how to install and run a minimal example.\n",
    "- Links to more detailed documentation (e.g., `docs/` folder).\n",
    "- Contribution guidelines.\n",
    "- License information.\n",

    "## **89.3 API Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "If your system exposes a REST API (as we did in Chapter 74), you must document it for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **89.3.1 OpenAPI / Swagger**\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation. This is a huge advantage. You just need to add descriptive docstrings to your endpoints and use Pydantic models with field descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n",
    "from datetime import date\n",
    "\n",
    "class PredictionRequest(BaseModel):\n",

    "    Predict the closing price for a given symbol and date.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The model uses features up to the day before the requested date.\n",
    "    If data for that symbol and date is insufficient, returns an error.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting Swagger UI (at `/docs`) provides an interactive interface for users to test the API and see documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **89.3.2 API Reference in Static Docs**\n",
    "\n",
    "For users who prefer static documentation, you can use tools like `redoc` or integrate the OpenAPI spec into your Sphinx site using `sphinxcontrib-openapi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **89.4 Architecture Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "High‑level architecture documentation helps new team members understand how the system fits together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **89.4.1 C4 Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The C4 model (Context, Containers, Components, Code) is a lightweight approach to documenting software architecture. You can create diagrams as code using tools like **PlantUML** or **Structurizr**.\n",

    "## Model Details\n",
    "- **Version**: 2.3.0\n",
    "- **Type**: XGBoost Regressor\n",
    "- **Date trained**: 2024-06-01\n",
    "- **Training data**: NEPSE daily data 2018-2023\n",
    "- **Features**: 15 features including lags, moving averages, RSI, volume Z‑score\n",
    "- **License**: Proprietary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intended Use\n",
    "- Predict next‑day closing price for NEPSE stocks.\n",
    "- Should be used as one input among many in trading decisions, not as a sole basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factors\n",
    "- Model was trained on data from a single exchange (NEPSE). It may not generalise to other exchanges.\n",
    "- Performance may vary across stocks with different liquidity and volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics\n",
    "- **Overall MAE**: 12.34\n",
    "- **MAE by volatility quartile**:\n",

    "## Evaluation Data\n",
    "- Test period: Jan‑Jun 2024 (out‑of‑time)\n",
    "- Distribution matches training period (no significant drift detected)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical Considerations\n",
    "- The model does not use sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender).\n",
    "- Predictions are uncertain; users should be aware of limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats and Recommendations\n",
    "- Model performance degrades during extreme market events (e.g., circuit breaker days).\n",
    "- Retraining is recommended monthly.\n",

    "## 89.7 Data Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, datasets should be documented with **data sheets** (Gebru et al., 2018). A data sheet includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Motivation**: Why was the dataset created?\n",
    "- **Composition**: What instances does it contain? (e.g., stocks, dates, features)\n",
    "- **Collection process**: How was the data collected? (e.g., from NEPSE CSV)\n",
    "- **Preprocessing**: Any cleaning, imputation, or feature engineering applied.\n",
    "- **Uses**: What tasks is the dataset suitable for? What should it not be used for?\n",
    "- **Distribution**: How is the data shared? (e.g., private S3 bucket)\n",
    "- **Maintenance**: Who maintains it? How are updates handled?\n",

    "**Initial Checks**:\n",
    "1. Log into the ingestion server: `ssh ingestion‑server`\n",
    "2. Check the ingestion logs: `journalctl -u nepse‑ingestion -n 50`\n",
    "3. Verify that the source CSV exists in the configured S3 bucket: `aws s3 ls s3://nepse-raw/ --recursive | grep $(date +%Y-%m-%d)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resolution**:\n",
    "- If source file missing, contact NEPSE data provider (see contacts in wiki).\n",

    "In this chapter, we explored the multifaceted world of documentation for a time‑series prediction system. We covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code documentation** with docstrings and READMEs.\n",
    "- **API documentation** using OpenAPI and tools like FastAPI.\n",
    "- **Architecture documentation** with the C4 model and diagrams as code.\n",
    "- **User documentation** including guides, tutorials, and FAQs.\n",
    "- **Model documentation** with model cards.\n",
    "- **Data documentation** with datasheets.\n",
    "- **Operational documentation** (runbooks) for incident response.\n",
    "- **Team wikis** as a central knowledge repository.\n",
    "- **Automation tools** (Sphinx, MkDocs, Jupyter Book) and CI integration.\n",
    "- **Maintenance** practices to keep documentation fresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good documentation is an investment that pays off in faster onboarding, fewer incidents, and better collaboration. By treating documentation as a first‑class citizen, you ensure that the NEPSE prediction system remains understandable and maintainable for years to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we will discuss **Quality Assurance**, focusing on how to test and validate both the software and the models in your system.\n",
