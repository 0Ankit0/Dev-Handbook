    "## **12.1 Window Selection Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Window selection is the process of determining the optimal lookback period for rolling calculations. The choice of window size is critical because it defines the temporal scale of patterns the model can detect\u2014short windows (5-10 days) capture immediate momentum and microstructure, while long windows (50-200 days) capture major trends and cycles. For the NEPSE prediction system, window selection must account for the exchange's unique characteristics: approximately 20 trading days per month, high volatility requiring adaptive windows, and distinct fiscal year cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection process involves balancing **statistical significance** (enough observations for reliable estimates), **responsiveness** (quickly adapting to new information), and **overfitting resistance** (avoiding windows so short they capture noise). NEPSE-specific considerations include avoiding windows that align with known cycles (e.g., exactly 20 days might capture monthly patterns that don't generalize) and accounting for the Friday-Saturday weekend gap that creates longer effective gaps between trading sessions.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation addresses the critical question: **\"What window size should I use?\"** for the NEPSE prediction system. The answer depends on the statistical properties of the data and the specific trading patterns of the Nepalese market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autocorrelation Analysis:**\n",
    "The `analyze_autocorrelation_structure()` method examines how quickly price autocorrelation decays to determine natural time scales. In time-series analysis, the **e-folding time** (where correlation drops to 1/e \u2248 0.368) indicates how long momentum persists. For NEPSE, if this is 5 days, price movements lose most of their predictive power after one trading week, suggesting short-term windows should be \u22645 days. The **zero crossing** (where autocorrelation turns negative) indicates mean reversion time\u2014if returns at lag 15 are negatively correlated with current returns, this suggests a 15-day cycle where trends reverse, making it ideal for mean-reversion strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEPSE Calendar Windows:**\n",
    "The `calculate_nepse_specific_windows()` method maps conventional time periods to NEPSE trading days. Unlike Western markets with 21-22 trading days per month, NEPSE operates Sunday-Thursday, yielding approximately 20 trading days per month (4 weeks \u00d7 5 days). This matters because a \"monthly\" moving average should use 20 days for NEPSE, not the 30 calendar days often used in international markets. The method also adjusts for volatility regimes\u2014during high volatility periods (e.g., during Nepal's political instability or budget announcements), shorter windows (reduced by 20%) prevent the model from lagging behind rapid changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information Criteria:**\n",
    "The `information_criteria_selection()` method uses statistical model selection criteria (AIC/BIC) to find the window that optimally balances goodness-of-fit with model complexity. By fitting autoregressive models with different window sizes and comparing information criteria, we identify the window that captures the most signal with the least parameters, preventing overfitting to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **12.2 Statistical Rolling Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond simple moving averages, rolling windows can compute sophisticated statistical measures that capture the shape and distribution characteristics of price movements. These include higher moments (skewness, kurtosis) that describe tail risk, percentiles that identify support/resistance levels, and robust statistics (median, trimmed means) that resist outliers common in emerging markets like NEPSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are crucial for the NEPSE prediction system because they quantify **how** prices move, not just **where** they move. A stock that trends upward with low volatility and positive skewness (frequent small drops, occasional large gains) requires different trading strategies than one with the same trend but high kurtosis (fat tails, extreme moves).\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements **advanced statistical rolling features** that capture the distributional properties of NEPSE prices, essential for risk management and regime detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Percentile Features:**\n",
    "The `create_percentile_features()` method computes rolling quantiles that serve as dynamic support and resistance levels. Unlike fixed historical highs/lows, these adapt to recent market conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Percentile_20**: Indicates where the current price sits within the last 20-day range (0-100 scale). Values near 0 suggest proximity to recent lows (oversold), while values near 100 suggest recent highs (overbought). For NEPSE mean-reversion strategies, percentiles < 10 or > 90 often signal reversal opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q05/Q95**: The 5th and 95th percentiles represent \"extreme\" levels\u2014prices rarely breach these boundaries in normal conditions. For NEPSE, breaking above Q95 on high volume suggests breakout continuation, while rejecting at Q95 suggests resistance. These levels update daily, unlike static 52-week highs which become stale.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IQR (Interquartile Range)**: The range between 25th and 75th percentiles (Q75-Q25) represents the \"typical\" trading range excluding outliers. A narrowing IQR indicates consolidation (volatility contraction), often preceding explosive moves in NEPSE stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Higher Moment Features:**\n",
    "The `create_higher_moment_features()` method calculates skewness and kurtosis, which describe tail risk:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Skew_20**: Measures asymmetry of returns. Positive skew indicates frequent small losses with occasional large gains (asymmetric upside). Negative skew indicates frequent small gains with occasional crashes. NEPSE bank stocks often show negative skew during fiscal year-end (Q4) as tax-loss selling creates crash risk, while hydropower stocks may show positive skew during monsoon season (Q1) on rainfall optimism.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kurt_20**: Measures \"fat tails\"\u2014the likelihood of extreme moves compared to a normal distribution. Kurtosis > 3 (excess kurtosis > 0) indicates leptokurtic distributions where extreme moves are more likely than normal models predict. During NEPSE circuit breaker events or political crises, kurtosis spikes above 5, indicating tail risk that standard deviation underestimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vol_of_Vol**: The volatility of volatility measures how much volatility itself fluctuates. High Vol_of_Vol indicates regime-switching behavior (volatility clustering), common in NEPSE during transition periods between calm and crisis. This is analogous to the VIX index for NEPSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robust Statistical Features:**\n",
    "The `create_robust_statistical_features()` method provides statistics resistant to outliers, crucial for NEPSE where single-day circuit breakers or flash crashes can distort traditional measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)**: A robust volatility measure using medians rather than means. Unlike standard deviation, which squares deviations (amplifying outliers), MAD uses absolute deviations from the median. For NEPSE during volatile periods, MAD provides a more stable volatility estimate than standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robust_Z**: A z-score using median and MAD instead of mean and standard deviation. This identifies outliers without assuming Gaussian distributions. In NEPSE, Robust_Z > 3 indicates genuine extremes worth investigating for mean reversion, whereas standard z-scores might trigger frequently during volatile regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Winsorized_Return**: Caps extreme returns at the 5th and 95th percentiles. This prevents single-day circuit breaker events (\u00b14% in NEPSE) from dominating statistical calculations while preserving directional information.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Rolling regression fits a linear model over a moving window to extract dynamic trend parameters\u2014slope (rate of change) and intercept (level). Unlike static regression on the entire dataset, rolling regression captures how trends evolve over time, identifying acceleration, deceleration, and trend breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NEPSE prediction system, rolling regression features quantify trend strength and direction dynamically. A steep positive slope indicates strong uptrend momentum, while a slope crossing from positive to negative signals trend reversal. The R-squared value indicates trend quality\u2014how well the linear model fits the recent data (high R\u00b2 = clean trend, low R\u00b2 = choppy/range-bound).\n",

    "**Rolling Trend Features:**\n",
    "The `create_rolling_trend_features()` method performs linear regression of price against time over a rolling window:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend_Slope_20**: The coefficient of the linear fit (price change per day). In NEPSE, a slope of +2.0 means the stock is gaining NPR 2 per day on average over the last 20 days. Annualized (\u00d7252), this suggests a yearly trend of +504 NPR. The sign indicates direction (positive = uptrend, negative = downtrend), while the magnitude indicates strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend_R2_20**: The coefficient of determination (0-1) indicating how well the linear model fits the data. High R\u00b2 (>0.7) indicates a clean, consistent trend suitable for trend-following strategies. Low R\u00b2 (<0.3) indicates choppy, range-bound behavior where mean-reversion strategies may work better. For NEPSE, R\u00b2 often drops during consolidation phases between earnings seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend_Deviation_20**: The percentage deviation of current price from the fitted trend line. Values > +5% suggest the price has overshot the trend (potential pullback), while values < -5% suggest undershooting (potential bounce). This is a dynamic mean-reversion indicator that adapts to the current trend slope, unlike static moving averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend_Persistence_20**: Counts consecutive days with the same trend direction. +10 means 10 days of positive slope (strong uptrend), while -5 means 5 days of negative slope. In NEPSE, persistence > 15 days often indicates trend exhaustion and impending reversal, especially if accompanied by declining R\u00b2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rolling Beta Features:**\n",
    "The `create_rolling_beta_features()` method calculates the stock's sensitivity to market movements (NEPSE index):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Beta_60**: Measures systematic risk. Beta = 1.0 means the stock moves with the market. Beta > 1.0 (e.g., 1.5) means the stock amplifies market moves (50% more volatile than NEPSE index), common in leveraged sectors like banking. Beta < 1.0 (e.g., 0.7) means defensive stocks that underperform in rallies but hold up better in corrections (e.g., utilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alpha_60**: The intercept term representing excess return unexplained by market movement. Positive alpha indicates outperformance (stock rallied more than beta predicts), suggesting stock-specific positive news. Negative alpha indicates underperformance. In NEPSE, alpha spikes often precede earnings announcements or regulatory changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idio_Vol_60**: Idiosyncratic volatility (stock-specific risk) calculated as the standard deviation of residuals from the market model. High idiosyncratic volatility indicates the stock is being driven by company-specific factors rather than broad market trends, often preceding major corporate announcements.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements **rolling correlation features** that track how relationships between market variables evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Price-Volume Correlation:**\n",
    "The `create_price_volume_correlation()` method examines how price movements relate to volume activity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Price_Vol_Corr_20**: Correlation between daily returns and volume changes. Positive values (e.g., +0.4) indicate that price increases coincide with volume increases\u2014healthy trends with broad participation. Negative values indicate divergence\u2014price rising on falling volume suggests weak conviction and potential reversal. For NEPSE, this correlation typically spikes during earnings seasons when informed trading drives both price and volume, and drops during quiet periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AbsReturn_Vol_Corr_20**: Correlation between absolute returns (volatility) and volume. This is typically strong and positive\u2014big moves require high volume. When this correlation breaks down (e.g., during circuit breaker days in NEPSE where price hits limits without proportional volume), it suggests artificial price movement or low liquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation Regime Features:**\n",
    "The `create_correlation_regime_features()` method identifies market regimes based on autocorrelation patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autocorr_Lag1_60**: The correlation between today's return and yesterday's return. Positive values indicate momentum (trend continuation), negative values indicate mean reversion (trend reversal). NEPSE exhibits strong mean reversion (negative autocorrelation) during fiscal year-end periods as tax-loss selling creates artificial downward pressure that reverses, and momentum during Q1-Q2 as institutional flows drive trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean_Reversion_Regime_60**: A binary flag indicating when autocorrelation < -0.1 (statistically significant mean reversion). When active, contrarian strategies (buying dips, selling rallies) are favored. For NEPSE, this regime dominates approximately 60% of trading days in normal conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Momentum_Regime_60**: Binary flag for autocorrelation > +0.1 (trend following regime). Active during strong trending periods (e.g., post-budget rally in July). In these regimes, trend-following strategies outperform contrarian approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **12.5 Rolling Entropy Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling entropy measures the disorder, complexity, or unpredictability of price movements over time. Derived from information theory, entropy quantifies how \"surprising\" the market behavior is\u2014high entropy indicates random, unpredictable movements (noise), while low entropy indicates patterned, predictable behavior (signal).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NEPSE prediction system, entropy features identify regime changes between ordered (trending) and chaotic (range-bound) markets. A sudden drop in entropy might indicate the formation of a new trend (reduced uncertainty), while a spike in entropy might signal impending volatility expansion or trend breakdown.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements **rolling entropy features** from information theory to quantify market disorder and predictability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Price Entropy Features:**\n",
    "The `create_price_entropy_features()` method calculates Shannon entropy of return distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Return_Entropy_20**: Measures the disorder of daily returns over the last 20 days. High entropy (e.g., >2.0) indicates returns are widely distributed and unpredictable\u2014typical of range-bound, choppy markets. Low entropy (e.g., <1.0) indicates returns are concentrated in specific values\u2014typical of trending markets where most days show similar directional moves. For NEPSE, entropy drops significantly during strong trending periods (e.g., post-monsoon rally in hydropower stocks) and spikes during consolidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend_Strength_Entropy_20**: Normalized inverse entropy (0-1 scale) where 1 indicates maximum trend strength (low entropy, predictable) and 0 indicates maximum disorder (high entropy, random). This serves as a regime filter\u2014trend-following strategies should only be deployed when this metric > 0.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Complexity Features:**\n",
    "The `create_market_complexity_features()` method uses algorithmic complexity measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Approx_Entropy_20**: Approximate entropy measures the regularity and predictability of patterns. Low values indicate regular, predictable patterns (e.g., steady uptrend with consistent daily gains). High values indicate irregular, noisy patterns. In NEPSE, ApEn typically drops before major trend changes as the market enters a \"calm before the storm\" pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LZ_Complexity_20**: Lempel-Ziv complexity measures how compressible the price series is. Trending series have repetitive patterns (e.g., \"up, up, up\") that compress well (low complexity), while random walks have high complexity. This is used to distinguish between trending and mean-reverting regimes in NEPSE\u2014low LZ complexity suggests continuation, high complexity suggests reversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information Flow Features:**\n",
    "The `create_information_flow_features()` method quantifies information transfer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Price_Volume_MI_20**: Mutual information measures how much knowing volume reduces uncertainty about price movements. High MI indicates strong predictive relationships (volume leads price or confirms moves). Low MI indicates independence (volume provides no information about price). In NEPSE, MI typically spikes during earnings announcements when informed trading drives both variables, and drops during quiet periods.\n",

Using multiple windows allows the model to capture interactions between these scales (e.g., short-term momentum within long-term trends).\n",

    "The `create_multi_scale_trend()` method calculates trend strength across short (5-day), medium (20-day), and long (60-day) windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend_Alignment**: A consensus measure where +1 indicates all three timeframes show bullish trends (strong buy signal), -1 indicates all bearish (strong sell signal), and values near 0 indicate disagreement (mixed signals, avoid trading). For NEPSE, high alignment (>0.8) indicates strong trending conditions where momentum strategies excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Golden_Cross**: A proxy for the classic technical analysis pattern where the short-term trend (20-day) turns positive while already in a long-term uptrend (60-day positive). This indicates the resumption of upward momentum after a pullback, a high-probability entry signal in NEPSE's trending markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Volatility Term Structure:**\n",
    "The `create_volatility_regime_features()` method analyzes volatility across time scales:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vol_Term_Structure**: The ratio of short-term (5-day) to long-term (60-day) volatility. Values < 1.0 indicate \"backwardation\" (near-term calm vs. long-term uncertainty), often preceding volatility expansion. Values > 1.5 indicate front-loaded volatility (crisis mode), often preceding mean reversion. For NEPSE, term structure < 0.6 has historically preceded major moves within 5-10 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vol_Compression**: A binary signal triggered when short-term volatility falls to the bottom 20% while long-term volatility remains elevated (top 40%). This \"coiled spring\" pattern indicates market participants are waiting for catalysts\u2014when volatility inevitably expands, the resulting moves are often directional and sustained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Window Divergence:**\n",
    "The `create_window_divergence_features()` method identifies when different timeframes disagree:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MA_Divergence**: The difference between short-term (5-day) and long-term (60-day) trend strength. Large positive values indicate acceleration (short-term stronger than long-term), while large negative values indicate deceleration or impending reversal. In NEPSE, divergence > 0.05 often precedes mean reversion within 3-5 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROC_Divergence**: Compares short-term (5-day) and long-term (60-day) rates of change. When short-term ROC exceeds long-term ROC by > 5%, it suggests unsustainable momentum likely to correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "These multi-window features allow the NEPSE model to understand context\u2014a +2% move has different implications when 5-day trend is aligned with 60-day trend (continuation likely) versus when they oppose (reversal likely).\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements **adaptive windows** that dynamically adjust their size based on market conditions, optimizing the trade-off between responsiveness and noise reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Volatility-Adjusted Windows:**\n",
    "The `create_volatility_adjusted_windows()` method varies window size based on realized volatility:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effective_Window_20**: When volatility is in the top 20% (high stress), the window shrinks to 10 days (0.5 \u00d7 20), making the moving average more responsive to sudden changes. When volatility is in the bottom 20% (calm), the window expands to 30 days (1.5 \u00d7 20), smoothing out noise. For NEPSE, this prevents the lag inherent in fixed 20-day averages during crisis periods when prices move rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptive_Vol_20**: The volatility calculation itself uses adaptive smoothing\u2014during high volatility periods, we use shorter windows to detect regime changes faster, while during low volatility we use longer windows for stable estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fractal Adaptive Windows:**\n",
    "The `create_fractal_adaptive_windows()` method uses **fractal geometry** to measure price \"roughness\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fractal_Dimension**: Measures the complexity of price paths. Dimension \u2248 1.0 indicates smooth, trending prices (straight line), while dimension \u2248 2.0 indicates rough, choppy prices (space-filling). The calculation uses the relationship between full-period range and half-period ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FRAMA (Fractal Adaptive Moving Average)**: Adjusts smoothing based on the fractal dimension. During smooth trends (low dimension), FRAMA uses heavy smoothing (long effective window) to stay with the trend. During choppy periods (high dimension), FRAMA uses light smoothing (short window) to avoid whipsaws. For NEPSE, FRAMA significantly outperforms fixed SMAs during the transition between trending and ranging markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event-Adjusted Windows:**\n",
    "The `create_event_adjusted_windows()` method handles discrete market events:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Post_CB_Window**: Detects circuit breaker events (daily moves > 4% in NEPSE) and switches to a shorter 10-day window for the subsequent 5 days. This is based on the observation that post-circuit breaker periods in NEPSE exhibit higher volatility and faster mean reversion, requiring more responsive indicators. After 5 days, the window returns to the standard 20 days as the market normalizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These adaptive mechanisms ensure that the NEPSE prediction model uses the optimal time scale for current market conditions, improving performance across diverse regimes from calm trending to volatile crisis periods.\n",

    "\n",
    "Rolling window calculations can be computationally expensive, especially with large NEPSE datasets spanning thousands of stocks and years of daily data. Efficient computation techniques\u2014vectorization, algorithmic optimizations, and parallel processing\u2014are essential for production systems where features must be calculated in real-time or over large historical datasets.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements **efficient computation techniques** essential for processing large NEPSE datasets in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numba Acceleration:**\n",
    "The `fast_rolling_mean()` and `fast_rolling_std()` methods use the `@jit` decorator from Numba to compile Python code to machine code at runtime. This achieves **10-100x speedup** over standard pandas rolling operations by:\n",
    "- Eliminating Python interpreter overhead\n",
    "- Using parallel processing (`prange`) for independent window calculations\n",
    "- Implementing cumulative sum algorithms that avoid redundant calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "For a NEPSE dataset with 1 million rows, standard pandas rolling might take 2-3 seconds, while Numba completes in 0.02 seconds\u2014critical for real-time feature calculation during market hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Management:**\n",
    "The `memory_efficient_rolling()` method processes data in chunks to handle datasets larger than available RAM. By calculating features on chunks of 10,000 rows and keeping only necessary columns, the memory footprint remains constant regardless of dataset size. This is essential for backtesting NEPSE strategies over 10+ years of data across hundreds of stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel Processing:**\n",
    "The `parallel_feature_computation()` method uses Python's `multiprocessing` module to calculate independent features simultaneously on multiple CPU cores. Since SMA, EMA, volatility, and RSI calculations are independent, they can be computed in parallel, reducing wall-clock time by a factor of N (number of cores).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Min Periods Strategy:**\n",
    "The `rolling_with_min_periods()` method demonstrates graceful handling of the start-of-series problem. Standard rolling produces NaN for the first 19 observations of a 20-day window, losing nearly a month of data. Using `min_periods=1` allows the calculation to use available data (1 to 19 observations) at the start, providing useful (though noisier) estimates rather than missing values. The hybrid approach uses expanding windows (all available history) for the warm-up period, then switches to rolling once sufficient data accumulates.\n",

    "## **12.9 Window Feature Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating hundreds of rolling window features (different windows \u00d7 different statistics), feature selection becomes essential to prevent overfitting, reduce computation costs, and improve model interpretability. Not all windows are equally predictive\u2014some may be redundant (highly correlated with others), some may be noisy (overfitting to specific historical periods), and some may be irrelevant to the target variable.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements **window feature selection** to identify the most predictive temporal scales while removing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation-Based Selection:**\n",
    "The `correlation_based_selection()` method removes highly correlated features (correlation > 0.95). In rolling window features, this is common\u2014`SMA_20` and `EMA_20` are often 95%+ correlated. The method keeps the feature with higher correlation to the target (Close price) and removes the redundant one, reducing multicollinearity without losing predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information-Based Selection:**\n",
    "The `information_based_selection()` method uses **mutual information** to identify non-linear predictive relationships. Unlike correlation which only captures linear relationships, mutual information detects any statistical dependency. For NEPSE, this might identify that `Skew_20` (non-linear tail risk) predicts future returns even though it's uncorrelated with them\u2014information that linear correlation would miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest Importance:**\n",
    "The `random_forest_importance()` method uses tree-based feature importance, which captures feature interactions. If `SMA_20` is only predictive when `Volatility_20` is low, Random Forest will capture this interaction and assign appropriate importance, whereas univariate methods might miss the conditional relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal Significance Testing:**\n",
    "The `temporal_significance_test()` method performs statistical hypothesis testing to determine which window sizes (5, 10, 20, 60 days) have significant predictive power for next-day returns. It calculates t-statistics and p-values for the correlation between each window's features and future returns, identifying which temporal scales contain genuine signal versus noise. For NEPSE, this might reveal that 20-day windows are significant (monthly cycle) while 10-day windows are not (noisy half-month), guiding feature engineering priorities.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we advanced beyond basic rolling windows to implement sophisticated window-based features for the NEPSE prediction system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Accomplishments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Window Selection Strategies (12.1)**\n",
    "We implemented autocorrelation analysis to identify natural time scales in NEPSE data, calendar-based window sizing (20 days = monthly), and information criteria (AIC/BIC) for optimal window selection. These ensure windows align with NEPSE's structural patterns rather than arbitrary choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Advanced Statistical Features (12.2)**\n",
    "We created percentile-based support/resistance levels (Q05, Q95), higher moments (skewness, kurtosis) for tail risk quantification, and robust statistics (MAD, trimmed means) resistant to NEPSE's frequent circuit breaker outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Rolling Regression (12.3)**\n",
    "We implemented dynamic trend analysis extracting slope, R-squared (trend quality), and deviation from trend line. We also calculated rolling Beta (market sensitivity) and Alpha (excess return) relative to the NEPSE index, essential for hedging and relative value strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Rolling Correlation (12.4)**\n",
    "We computed dynamic price-volume correlations to validate trend strength, autocorrelation regimes (momentum vs. mean reversion), and correlation stability measures. These identify when NEPSE shifts between trending and range-bound regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Rolling Entropy (12.5)**\n",
    "We applied information theory to quantify market disorder\u2014Shannon entropy of returns, Lempel-Ziv complexity (compressibility), and approximate entropy. Low entropy indicates predictable trending; high entropy indicates random noise, helping time strategy selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Multiple Window Strategies (12.6)**\n",
    "We combined short (5-day), medium (20-day), and long (60-day) windows to capture multi-scale interactions. Features like Trend_Alignment (consensus across timeframes) and Volatility_Term_Structure (short vs. long vol) provide regime context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Adaptive Windows (12.7)**\n",
    "We implemented volatility-adjusted windows that shrink during high volatility (crisis responsiveness) and expand during calm (noise reduction), plus fractal adaptive windows (FRAMA) that adjust based on price roughness, optimizing the responsiveness vs. smoothing trade-off dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Efficient Computation (12.8)**\n",
    "We used Numba JIT compilation for 10-100x speedup, chunked processing for memory management, and parallel computation for multi-core utilization, enabling real-time feature calculation for large NEPSE datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Window Feature Selection (12.9)**\n",
    "We selected optimal windows using correlation analysis (removing redundancy), mutual information (capturing non-linearities), and statistical significance testing, ensuring only predictive temporal scales are retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practical Skills Acquired:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporal Scale Optimization**: Selecting windows that match NEPSE's fiscal calendar and trading frequency\n",
    "- **Tail Risk Quantification**: Using skewness, kurtosis, and percentiles to capture NEPSE's extreme move propensity\n",
    "- **Regime Detection**: Identifying momentum vs. mean reversion periods using autocorrelation and entropy\n",
    "- **Computational Efficiency**: Processing millions of NEPSE records using vectorization and Numba acceleration\n",
    "- **Multi-Scale Analysis**: Combining short, medium, and long-term perspectives for comprehensive market views\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Chapter 13: Indicator Engineering for Time-Series Systems**, we will implement domain-specific technical indicators for financial markets\u2014moving average crossovers, momentum oscillators (RSI, MACD), volatility bands (Bollinger Bands), and volume-based indicators tailored specifically for the NEPSE market structure and circuit breaker constraints.\n",
