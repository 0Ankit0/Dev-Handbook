    "\n",
    "## **13.1 Understanding Domain-Specific Indicators**\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicator engineering is the process of transforming raw time-series data into meaningful signals that capture underlying patterns, momentum, volatility, and market microstructure. In financial time-series prediction, particularly for the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE), indicators serve as the bridge between raw price/volume data and machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Indicators Matter:**\n",
    "- **Noise Reduction**: Raw price data contains significant noise; indicators smooth this noise while preserving signal\n",
    "- **Feature Normalization**: Indicators like Z-scores and percentiles provide scale-invariant features\n",
    "- **Temporal Patterns**: Moving averages and momentum indicators capture trend direction and strength\n",
    "- **Predictive Power**: Properly engineered indicators often have higher correlation with future returns than raw prices\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEPSE Data Context:**\n",
    "For the NEPSE system using the CSV format: `S.No,Symbol,Conf.,Open,High,Low,Close,LTP,...`, we will engineer indicators using `Close` (closing price), `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Vol` (volume), and `VWAP` (Volume Weighted Average Price).\n",

    "## **13.2 Trend-Based Indicators**\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend indicators help identify the direction and strength of price movements over time. They smooth out short-term fluctuations to reveal underlying trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **13.2.1 Moving Averages**\n",

    "Moving averages are the foundation of trend analysis. They calculate the average price over a specific window, smoothing out short-term volatility.\n",

    "$$SMA_t = \\frac{P_t + P_{t-1} + ... + P_{t-n+1}}{n}$$\n",

    "The `calculate_sma` function uses pandas' `rolling` method, which creates a sliding window of size `window` over the time-series. The `mean()` method computes the average for each window position. The `min_periods=1` parameter ensures that even for the first few rows where we don't have a full window, we still calculate the average of available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `add_moving_averages_to_nepse` function demonstrates practical application by calculating multiple SMAs (5, 20, 50-day) which represent different trend horizons. It also creates derived features like `Price_Above_SMA20` (a binary indicator of trend direction) and `Distance_From_SMA20` (magnitude of deviation from trend).\n",

    "The `calculate_ema` function implements the Exponential Moving Average using pandas' `ewm` (exponentially weighted moving) method. The key parameter is `span=window`, which defines the decay in terms of the window size. The formula used is $\\alpha = 2/(span+1)$, which matches the standard EMA calculation where recent prices receive exponentially decreasing weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_macd` function demonstrates a practical application of EMAs in technical analysis. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is calculated by subtracting the slow EMA (26-period) from the fast EMA (12-period). This difference (MACD Line) is then smoothed with a 9-period EMA to create the Signal Line. The Histogram represents the difference between MACD and Signal lines, providing a visual representation of momentum shifts. For NEPSE stocks, positive histogram values suggest bullish momentum, while negative values indicate bearish momentum.\n",

    "**Detailed Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_adx` function implements the complete Average Directional Index calculation pipeline specifically tailored for NEPSE stock data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: True Range Calculation**\n",
    "The True Range (TR) captures the greatest of three measurements: the current high-low range, the absolute distance from today's high to yesterday's close, or today's low to yesterday's close. This accounts for gap-up or gap-down openings common in NEPSE stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Directional Movement**\n",
    "+DM (Positive Directional Movement) measures upward pressure by comparing today's high to yesterday's high, but only if this difference exceeds the downward movement (yesterday's low minus today's low). Conversely, -DM measures downward pressure. This helps identify whether NEPSE stocks are gaining bullish or bearish momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Wilder's Smoothing**\n",
    "Unlike simple moving averages, Wilder's smoothing applies an exponential moving average with a smoothing factor of $\\frac{1}{n}$. This gives more weight to recent data while maintaining stability, crucial for NEPSE's sometimes volatile but trending nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Directional Indices**\n",
    "+DI and -DI normalize the directional movements by the Average True Range, converting them to percentages (0-100). When +DI > -DI for a NEPSE stock, it indicates bullish dominance; when reversed, bearish pressure dominates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: ADX Calculation**\n",
    "The Directional Index (DX) measures the absolute difference between +DI and -DI relative to their sum, giving the strength of trend regardless of direction. Smoothing DX with Wilder's method yields ADX. For NEPSE trading:\n",
    "- **ADX < 20**: The stock is ranging (sideways), avoid trend-following\n",
    "- **ADX 20-40**: Trend developing, suitable for breakout entries\n",
    "- **ADX > 40**: Strong trend, ride it but watch for exhaustion signals\n",
    "\n",
    "### **13.2.2 Exponential Moving Averages**\n",
    "\n",
    "While covered in the ADX section above, EMAs deserve specific attention for NEPSE trend analysis. The EMA reacts faster to price changes than SMA, making it ideal for capturing early trend reversals in Nepali stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences for NEPSE:**\n",
    "- **EMA 12 vs EMA 26**: The difference forms the MACD line, widely used in NEPSE technical analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Logic:**\n",
    "The algorithm first decomposes price changes into gains (positive changes) and losses (absolute values of negative changes). It then applies Wilder's smoothing (an exponential moving average with $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{window}$) to both series. The Relative Strength (RS) is the ratio of average gains to average losses. Finally, RSI normalizes this ratio to the 0-100 scale using $100 - \\frac{100}{1+RS}$.\n",

    "**NEPSE-Specific Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **Overbought (>70)**: NEPSE stocks often exhibit strong momentum during bull markets. RSI > 70 suggests the stock is overextended and due for a correction or consolidation.\n",
    "- **Oversold (<30)**: During market panics or corrections, RSI < 30 indicates capitulation selling, often presenting buying opportunities for fundamentally strong Nepali companies.\n",
    "- **Divergences**: When NEPSE price makes a new high but RSI forms a lower high (bearish divergence), it signals weakening buying pressure despite higher prices, often preceding corrections. Conversely, bullish divergences (lower price lows, higher RSI lows) indicate accumulation.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_bollinger_bands` function implements one of the most versatile technical indicators for NEPSE analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Construction:**\n",
    "The middle band is the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average), serving as the baseline trend. The upper and lower bands are positioned 2 standard deviations away from the middle band. Statistically, this captures approximately 95% of price action assuming normal distribution, meaning prices outside these bands are statistically extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEPSE-Specific Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **PercentB (%B)**: This metric normalizes price position within the bands to a 0-1 scale. For NEPSE stocks, when %B > 0.8, the stock is in the upper 20% of its recent volatility range, suggesting overbought conditions. Conversely, %B < 0.2 suggests oversold conditions suitable for accumulation.\n",
    "- **Bandwidth**: Calculated as $\\frac{Upper - Lower}{Middle} \\times 100$, this measures volatility. A bandwidth squeeze (narrowing bands) in NEPSE often precedes significant breakouts due to low liquidity periods followed by news-driven movements.\n",
    "- **Squeeze Detection**: The function identifies when bandwidth is at a 120-day (6-month) low, indicating impending volatility expansion. For Nepali markets, this often correlates with quarterly earnings announcements or regulatory news.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_rsi` function implements the Relative Strength Index using Wilder's smoothing method, which is the standard approach in technical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation Process:**\n",
    "1. **Price Differencing**: Computes day-to-day price changes using `diff()`.\n",
    "2. **Gain/Loss Separation**: Separates positive changes (gains) from negative changes (losses). Losses are converted to absolute values.\n",
    "3. **Wilder's Smoothing**: Unlike simple moving averages, Wilder's method applies exponential smoothing with $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{window}$. This gives more weight to recent observations while maintaining the influence of older data, preventing sudden jumps when old data drops out of the window.\n",
    "4. **Relative Strength**: RS is the ratio of average gains to average losses. If average losses are zero (perfect uptrend), RS approaches infinity.\n",
    "5. **Normalization**: The formula $100 - \\frac{100}{1+RS}$ normalizes RS to a 0-100 scale. When RS is high (strong gains), RSI approaches 100. When RS is low (strong losses), RSI approaches 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEPSE-Specific Features:**\n",
    "The `calculate_rsi_features` function creates derived features particularly useful for Nepali stock prediction:\n",
    "- **RSI_Slope**: Measures whether momentum is accelerating or decelerating. Positive slope indicates strengthening momentum.\n",
    "- **RSI_Zone**: Categorizes RSI into actionable regions (Oversold <30, Bullish 30-50, Bearish 50-70, Overbought >70).\n",
    "- **Stochastic RSI**: Normalizes RSI itself to a 0-100 scale over the lookback period, making it more sensitive to short-term reversals in NEPSE's sometimes range-bound market.\n",

    "The `calculate_volatility_metrics` function provides a comprehensive volatility analysis suite essential for risk management in NEPSE trading. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard Deviation vs. Parkinson vs. Garman-Klass:**\n",
    "The function calculates three types of volatility estimators:\n",
    "1. **Close-to-Close (Standard)**: Uses only closing prices. Simple but ignores intraday information (High/Low/Open).\n",
    "2. **Parkinson**: Uses High-Low range. More efficient (uses intraday extremes) but ignores opening gaps.\n",
    "3. **Garman-Klass**: Uses full OHLC data. Most statistically efficient estimator, accounting for opening gaps and intraday range.\n",
    "\n",
    "For NEPSE stocks, Garman-Klass provides the most accurate volatility estimate because it captures the true range of price movement during the trading session (9:30 AM - 3:00 PM NPT).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Volatility Regime Classification:**\n",
    "The function classifies volatility into Low, Normal, and High regimes using statistical thresholds (mean ± standard deviation). This is crucial for NEPSE because:\n",
    "- **Low Volatility**: Often precedes major moves (earnings announcements, regulatory changes)\n",
    "- **High Volatility**: Usually occurs during market crashes or bubbles; indicates high risk but potential high reward\n",
    "- **Normal Volatility**: Suitable for standard trend-following strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_volatility_signals` function applies Bollinger Bands to the volatility series itself (volatility of volatility), identifying \"volatility squeezes\"—periods of unusually low volatility that historically precede significant price breakouts in NEPSE stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **13.4.2 Bollinger Bands**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bollinger Bands were covered in the volatility section above, but they serve dual purposes as both volatility and trend indicators.

    "\n",
    "**True Range Logic:**\n",
    "Unlike simple range (High - Low), True Range accounts for gaps between trading sessions. For NEPSE, which operates 5 days a week (Sunday-Thursday), gaps can occur due to overnight news. True Range captures the greatest of:\n",
    "1. Today's high-low range (normal intraday volatility)\n",
    "2. Distance from today's high to yesterday's close (gap up scenario)\n",
    "3. Distance from yesterday's close to today's low (gap down scenario)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wilder's Smoothing:**\n",
    "The function applies exponential smoothing with $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{14}$ (for default window), which creates a smoother volatility measure than simple moving averages. This prevents whipsaws during NEPSE's sometimes erratic short-term movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chandelier Exit Application:**\n",
    "The `calculate_chandelier_exit` function uses ATR for dynamic stop-loss placement. For NEPSE long positions, the exit level is set at the highest high over 22 days (approx 1 month of trading) minus 3x ATR. This trailing stop adjusts to volatility—tightening during calm periods to protect profits and widening during volatile periods to avoid whipsaws.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `calculate_obv_advanced` function implements On-Balance Volume, a cumulative flow-of-funds indicator essential for NEPSE due to the market's susceptibility to institutional manipulation and low float scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OBV Mechanics:**\n",
    "The algorithm maintains a running total where volume is added on up-days and subtracted on down-days. The logic is simple but powerful: if price closes higher than yesterday, all of today's volume is considered \"positive volume\" (buying pressure). If price closes lower, all volume is \"negative volume\" (selling pressure).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEPSE Institutional Flow Detection:**\n",
    "In the Nepali market, OBV is particularly valuable because:\n",
    "1. **Smart Money Tracking**: When NEPSE price is declining but OBV is rising (bullish divergence), it indicates accumulation by informed investors (promoters, institutions) who know the stock is undervalued. This often precedes positive news announcements.\n",
    "2. **Distribution Warning**: When price makes new highs but OBV fails to confirm (bearish divergence), it suggests institutional distribution—large players selling to retail investors at peaks. This is a high-probability sell signal in NEPSE.\n",
    "3. **Trend Confirmation**: When both price and OBV are making higher highs and higher lows, the uptrend is healthy and sustained by volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Features:**\n",
    "The function calculates OBV slope (5-period rate of change) to measure the intensity of accumulation/distribution. It also detects divergences by comparing price slope to OBV slope—when they move in opposite directions for 5 consecutive periods, it flags potential reversal points.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_volume_profile` function implements Volume Profile Analysis, a sophisticated technique that reveals where the majority of trading activity (volume) occurred at specific price levels, rather than just when.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Framework:**\n",
    "Unlike time-based indicators that show what happened when, Volume Profile shows what happened where. It divides the price range into bins (levels) and sums the volume that occurred at each level. This creates a histogram showing \"fair value\" areas where buyers and sellers agreed most frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "1. **Point of Control (POC)**: The price level with the highest traded volume. In NEPSE, the POC acts as a \"magnet\" or gravitational center for price. When price moves away from POC but lacks volume support, it tends to revert back to this level. Institutional traders in Nepal often use POC as a reference for \"fair value\" entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Value Area (VA)**: The price range containing approximately 70% of total volume (1 standard deviation in volume distribution). The Value Area High (VAH) and Value Area Low (VAL) act as dynamic support and resistance levels. For NEPSE:\n",
    "   - Breakout above VAH with volume = Strong bullish, target next resistance\n",
    "   - Breakdown below VAL with volume = Strong bearish, target next support\n",
    "   - Price inside VA = Balanced, fair value, range-bound strategies work best\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Volume Profile Shape**: The distribution shape reveals market structure:\n",
    "   - **D-shaped (bell curve)**: Balanced market, good for mean reversion\n",
    "   - **P-shaped (high volume at bottom)**: Accumulation, bullish\n",
    "   - **b-shaped (high volume at top)**: Distribution, bearish\n",
    "   - **Thin profile**: Low liquidity, avoid large positions\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEPSE Application:**\n",
    "For Nepali stocks, Volume Profile is particularly valuable because:\n",
    "- **Low Float Awareness**: Many NEPSE stocks have low free float. Volume Profile shows where major holders accumulated (thick volume areas) versus thin air (gaps) where price can move fast.\n",
    "- **Institutional Footprints**: Large volume nodes often represent institutional accumulation zones. When price returns to these levels, institutions often defend their positions, creating support.\n",
    "- **Breakout Validation**: In NEPSE, false breakouts are common. A breakout is only valid if price moves out of the Value Area on volume > 2x average, indicating genuine conviction rather than manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **13.5.3 On-Balance Volume (OBV)**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Percentile Calculation:**\n",
    "Using `percentileofscore` from scipy, the function calculates what percentage of historical prices (over the lookback window) are below the current price. A 90th percentile reading means the stock is trading higher than 90% of the past 20 (or 50, or 200) days—statistically overbought.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_stochastic_indicators` function implements the Stochastic Oscillator family, including Fast Stochastic (%K), Slow Stochastic (%D), and Stochastic RSI. These indicators are particularly effective for NEPSE because they normalize price action to a 0-100 scale regardless of the stock's absolute price, enabling comparison across the diverse price ranges in the Nepali market (from Rs. 10 to Rs. 10,000+).\n",
    "\n",
    "**%K Calculation:**\n",
    "The raw Stochastic (%K) measures where the current close sits within the recent high-low range:\n",
    "$$\\%K = \\frac{Close - Lowest Low}{Highest High - Lowest Low} \\times 100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A reading of 90 means the stock closed in the top 10% of the 14-day range (overbought). A reading of 10 means it closed in the bottom 10% (oversold).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Signal Generation:**\n",
    "The function generates buy signals when %K crosses above %D (signal line) while in oversold territory (<20), indicating the first sign of buying pressure after a decline. Sell signals occur when %K crosses below %D in overbought territory (>80).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Divergence Detection:**\n",
    "For NEPSE specifically, the function detects divergences by comparing price peaks/troughs to Stochastic peaks/troughs over 5-day windows. Bearish divergence (price higher high, Stochastic lower high) is a reliable reversal warning in Nepali stocks because it indicates weakening buying pressure despite higher prices—often seen when retail investors chase highs while institutions distribute.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_zscore_indicators` function standardizes price data to a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, enabling statistical arbitrage strategies in NEPSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Foundation:**\n",
    "The Z-Score formula $Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$ transforms raw prices into standard deviations from the mean. In a normal distribution:\n",
    "- 68% of data falls within $|Z| < 1$\n",
    "- 95% within $|Z| < 2$\n",
    "- 99.7% within $|Z| < 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEPSE Mean Reversion Strategy:**\n",
    "For Nepali stocks, which often exhibit mean-reverting behavior due to limited float and retail participation, extreme Z-Scores present high-probability trading opportunities:\n",
    "- **Z < -2**: Price is 2+ standard deviations below the mean. Statistically, there's a 95% probability it will revert toward the mean within the lookback window. This is a high-probability buy signal for NEPSE mean reversion strategies.\n",
    "- **Z > +2**: Price is 2+ standard deviations above the mean. 95% probability of reversion. Sell signal or short opportunity (if available).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Timeframe Composite:**\n",
    "The function calculates Z-Scores across 20, 50, and 200-day windows, then averages them into a Composite Z-Score. This prevents false signals from single timeframes. For example, a stock might be overbought short-term (20-day Z > 2) but oversold long-term (200-day Z < -1). The composite provides a balanced view.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-Score Momentum:**\n",
    "The rate of change of the Z-Score (`ZScore_Momentum`) indicates whether the stock is accelerating toward extremes (momentum increasing) or reverting toward mean (momentum decreasing). Positive momentum while Z > 1.5 indicates strong trend continuation; negative momentum while Z > 1.5 indicates trend exhaustion.\n",

    "- **Trend Indicators**: Moving averages of temperature to detect climate change trends\n",
    "- **Momentum**: Rate of change in atmospheric pressure to predict storm intensity\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NEPSEIndicatorSelector` class provides a systematic framework for selecting the optimal subset of technical indicators for machine learning models, addressing the curse of dimensionality and multicollinearity common in financial prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1: Candidate Generation**\n",
    "The framework generates 20+ standard indicators covering all categories (trend, momentum, volatility, volume, position). This ensures comprehensive coverage of potential predictive signals in NEPSE data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2: Predictive Power Evaluation**\n",
    "Using Spearman correlation (which captures monotonic but non-linear relationships), the framework tests each indicator's correlation with forward returns (1, 5, and 10 days ahead). Spearman is preferred over Pearson because financial relationships are rarely linear but often rank-correlated. For example, extremely high RSI (>80) may consistently predict negative returns, but the relationship isn't linear across all RSI values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 3: Non-Redundancy Selection**\n",
    "Financial indicators are highly correlated (e.g., RSI and Stochastic often move together). Including all of them in a model creates multicollinearity, making coefficients unstable and reducing generalization. The framework uses hierarchical clustering on the correlation matrix to group similar indicators, then selects the highest-variance (most informative) member from each cluster. This ensures the final indicator set captures diverse aspects of market behavior without redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEPSE Optimization:**\n",
    "For Nepali stocks, this selection process typically retains:\n",
    "- **Trend**: ADX (trend strength) rather than multiple MAs\n",
    "- **Momentum**: RSI (most robust) rather than Stochastic (noisy in low liquidity)\n",
    "- **Volatility**: ATR (used for position sizing) rather than Bollinger Width\n",
    "- **Volume**: Volume Ratio (simple but effective) rather than complex OBV derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "This optimized set of 4-6 indicators provides maximum predictive power with minimum computational overhead and collinearity for NEPSE prediction models.\n",

    "## **13.7 Cross-Domain Application**\n",
    "\n",
    "While this chapter focuses on NEPSE financial data, the indicator engineering principles apply universally:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retail Demand Forecasting:**\n",
    "- **Trend Indicators**: 7-day and 30-day moving averages of sales to detect seasonal trends\n",
    "- **Momentum**: Rate of change in foot traffic to predict inventory needs\n",
    "- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of daily sales to assess business risk\n",
    "- **Volume**: Transaction counts confirming price trends (average ticket size)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Energy Consumption:**\n",
    "- **Trend**: Moving averages of kWh usage to detect efficiency improvements\n",
    "- **Momentum**: Acceleration in consumption indicating equipment malfunction\n",
    "- **Z-Scores**: Statistical detection of anomalous consumption spikes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manufacturing/IoT:**\n",
    "- **Bollinger Bands**: Sensor readings to detect when machines drift out of spec\n",
    "- **RSI**: Vibration sensor momentum to predict bearing failure\n",
    "- **ATR**: Range of temperature fluctuations indicating system instability\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical transformations (smoothing, normalization, rate-of-change, standardization) are domain-agnostic and form the foundation of time-series feature engineering across all industries.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_nepse_liquidity_score` function demonstrates custom indicator development tailored to the unique characteristics of the Nepal Stock Exchange. Standard liquidity indicators (like Amihud or bid-ask spreads) require tick-level data unavailable in standard NEPSE CSV feeds. This custom indicator reconstructs liquidity proxies from OHLCV data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Volume Component (40 points)**: Measures relative volume compared to 20-day average. In NEPSE, liquidity is highly variable—some days see 10x normal volume during news events, other days see 0.1x during holidays or political uncertainty. This component scores high when volume is robust, indicating institutional participation and ease of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Price Efficiency Component (30 points)**: Measures price impact per unit of volume. In liquid markets, large volume should move price minimally. The formula $\\frac{\\Delta P}{Volume}$ measures this impact. Low impact = high efficiency = high liquidity score. This identifies NEPSE stocks where you can enter/exit large positions without significant slippage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Range Stability Component (30 points)**: Measures consistency of daily trading ranges. Liquid stocks exhibit consistent, orderly volatility. Illiquid NEPSE stocks often show erratic ranges—some days 1%, other days 10% on minimal volume. Low standard deviation of ranges indicates professional market making and liquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composite Scoring:**\n",
    "The final 0-100 score categorizes NEPSE stocks into:\n",
    "- **Low (0-30)**: Avoid for large positions. High slippage, erratic fills, wide spreads. Suitable only for long-term buy-and-hold.\n",
    "- **Medium (30-70)**: Acceptable for normal trading. Moderate slippage on entries/exits.\n",
    "- **High (70-100)**: Institutional grade. Tight spreads, deep order books, minimal market impact. Suitable for large positions and algorithmic execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This custom indicator enables quantitative screening of the entire NEPSE universe to identify which stocks are tradable given specific position size constraints and execution requirements.\n",
