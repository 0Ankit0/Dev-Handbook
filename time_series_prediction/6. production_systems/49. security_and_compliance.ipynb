    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In a financial prediction system like the one we are building for NEPSE, security and compliance are not optional\u2014they are foundational. The system handles potentially sensitive market data, and its predictions could influence trading decisions worth real money. A breach could lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties. Moreover, the model itself is an intellectual asset that competitors might want to steal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter covers the security and compliance landscape for machine learning systems. We will start with basic data security (encryption, access control), then move to API security, model\u2011specific threats, privacy, and finally regulatory compliance. Throughout, we will use the NEPSE system as a concrete example, showing how to apply these principles in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 49.1 Security Fundamentals for ML Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Security is often thought of as a set of barriers: firewalls, encryption, authentication. But in a modern ML system, the attack surface is broader. Threats can target:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data**: Unauthorized access, leakage, or tampering.\n",
    "- **Model**: Stealing the model, extracting training data, or fooling it with adversarial inputs.\n",
    "- **Infrastructure**: Compromising servers, containers, or cloud accounts.\n",
    "- **Supply chain**: Malicious dependencies or compromised model artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive security strategy must address all these layers. The principle of **defense in depth** applies: multiple layers of security controls so that if one fails, others still protect the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NEPSE system, we must assume that adversaries are sophisticated\u2014they could be competitors, malicious traders, or even state\u2011actors. Therefore, we will implement security at every level.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 49.2 Data Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is the lifeblood of any ML system. For NEPSE, the data includes historical prices, volumes, and potentially derived features. While this data is not personally identifiable, it is commercially sensitive. If a competitor gets our feature set, they could replicate our model. Moreover, if the data is tampered with, the model's predictions become unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.2.1 Encryption at Rest\n",
    "\n",
    "Data stored in databases, data lakes, or even CSV files must be encrypted. This ensures that if an attacker gains access to the storage media, they cannot read the data without the decryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Encrypting a CSV file with Python using `cryptography`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate a key (store this securely, e.g., in a key management service)\n",
    "key = Fernet.generate_key()\n",
    "cipher = Fernet(key)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encrypt a file\n",
    "with open('nepse_sensitive.csv', 'rb') as f:\n",
    "    data = f.read()\n",
    "encrypted = cipher.encrypt(data)\n",
    "with open('nepse_sensitive.enc', 'wb') as f:\n",
    "    f.write(encrypted)\n",
    "\n",
    "# To decrypt later:\n",
    "with open('nepse_sensitive.enc', 'rb') as f:\n",
    "    encrypted_data = f.read()\n",
    "decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data)\n",
    "# write decrypted to a temporary file or process in memory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, you would not manage keys like this. Instead, use a **Key Management Service (KMS)** such as AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or HashiCorp Vault. These services handle key rotation, access control, and auditing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Using AWS KMS to encrypt data in S3**\n",
    "\n",
    "When storing data in S3, you can enable server\u2011side encryption (SSE\u2011KMS) with a KMS key. This is configured at the bucket level or per object. All reads and writes are automatically encrypted/decrypted by S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.2.2 Encryption in Transit\n",
    "\n",
    "Data moving between services\u2014from your data source to Kafka, from Kafka to the stream processor, from the model to the API client\u2014must be encrypted to prevent eavesdropping or man\u2011in\u2011the\u2011middle attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TLS/SSL** is the standard. All web services (APIs) should use HTTPS.\n",
    "- For Kafka, enable SSL encryption between brokers and clients.\n",
    "- For databases, use TLS connections (e.g., PostgreSQL with `sslmode=require`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Enforcing HTTPS in a FastAPI app**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "import uvicorn\n",
    "from fastapi.middleware.https import HTTPSRedirectMiddleware\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "app.add_middleware(HTTPSRedirectMiddleware)  # Redirect all HTTP to HTTPS\n",
    "\n",
    "# ... routes ...\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000, ssl_keyfile=\"key.pem\", ssl_certfile=\"cert.pem\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In production behind a load balancer (e.g., AWS ALB), you can terminate TLS at the load balancer and use HTTP internally, which is simpler to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.2.3 Key Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys are the most sensitive assets. Best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Never hard\u2011code keys in source code. Use environment variables or secret management tools.\n",
    "- Rotate keys regularly.\n",
    "- Use separate keys for different environments (dev, staging, prod).\n",
    "- Restrict access to keys using IAM roles and policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Using environment variables for database passwords**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import psycopg2\n",
    "\n",
    "DB_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('DB_PASSWORD')\n",
    "conn = psycopg2.connect(\n",
    "    host='db.example.com',\n",
    "    user='myuser',\n",
    "    password=DB_PASSWORD,\n",
    "    sslmode='require'\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Kubernetes, you can store secrets and mount them as environment variables or files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 49.3 Access Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Access control ensures that only authenticated and authorized users or services can interact with your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.3.1 Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication verifies the identity of a client. For human users, this might be username/password with multi\u2011factor authentication (MFA). For machine\u2011to\u2011machine communication, API keys or JWT tokens are common.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: JWT authentication in FastAPI**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException\n",
    "from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer, HTTPAuthorizationCredentials\n",
    "import jwt\n",
    "\n",
    "SECRET_KEY = \"your-secret-key\"  # Store in environment variable\n",
    "ALGORITHM = \"HS256\"\n",
    "\n",
    "security = HTTPBearer()\n",
    "\n",
    "def verify_token(credentials: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Depends(security)):\n",
    "    token = credentials.credentials\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])\n",
    "        return payload\n",
    "    except jwt.PyJWTError:\n",
    "        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail=\"Invalid token\")\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/predict\")\n",
    "async def predict(symbol: str, user=Depends(verify_token)):\n",
    "    # Only authenticated users can access\n",
    "    return {\"symbol\": symbol, \"prediction\": 0.65}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The client includes a JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The `verify_token` dependency decodes and validates it. If invalid, a 403 error is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.3.2 Authorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. **Role\u2011Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a common model: users are assigned roles (e.g., `admin`, `analyst`, `viewer`), and permissions are granted to roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Adding role\u2011based authorization**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import wraps\n",
    "\n",
    "def require_role(required_role: str):\n",
    "    def decorator(func):\n",
    "        @wraps(func)\n",
    "        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "            user = kwargs.get('user')\n",
    "            if user.get('role') != required_role:\n",
    "                raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail=\"Insufficient permissions\")\n",
    "            return await func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "        return wrapper\n",
    "    return decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/admin/metrics\")\n",
    "@require_role(\"admin\")\n",
    "async def admin_metrics(user=Depends(verify_token)):\n",
    "    return {\"secret\": \"sensitive data\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.3.3 Service Accounts and IAM\n",
    "\n",
    "In cloud environments, use **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** roles for services. For example, a Kubernetes pod that needs to read from a specific S3 bucket should have an IAM role attached via a service account, not hard\u2011coded credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: AWS IAM role for an EKS pod**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: v1\n",
    "kind: ServiceAccount\n",
    "metadata:\n",
    "  name: nepse-predictor-sa\n",
    "  annotations:\n",
    "    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/nepse-s3-reader\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The pod assumes this role, and AWS SDKs automatically retrieve temporary credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 49.4 API Security\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction API is the entry point for users. It must be secured against various attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.4.1 Rate Limiting\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevent abuse and denial\u2011of\u2011service by limiting the number of requests a client can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Rate limiting with `slowapi` in FastAPI**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler\n",
    "from slowapi.util import get_remote_address\n",
    "\n",
    "limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)\n",
    "app.state.limiter = limiter\n",
    "app.add_exception_handler(429, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/predict\")\n",
    "@limiter.limit(\"100/minute\")\n",
    "async def predict(request: Request, symbol: str):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.4.2 Input Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Never trust user input. Validate and sanitise all parameters to prevent injection attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel, validator\n",
    "\n",
    "class PredictionRequest(BaseModel):\n",
    "    symbol: str\n",
    "    features: dict\n",
    "\n",
    "    @validator('symbol')\n",
    "    def symbol_must_be_valid(cls, v):\n",
    "        if not v.isalpha() or len(v) > 10:\n",
    "            raise ValueError('Invalid symbol')\n",
    "        return v.upper()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.4.3 HTTPS and Secure Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "Use HTTPS and set security headers to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware\n",
    "from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n",
    "\n",
    "app.add_middleware(TrustedHostMiddleware, allowed_hosts=[\"api.nepse.example.com\"])\n",
    "app.add_middleware(\n",
    "    CORSMiddleware,\n",
    "    allow_origins=[\"https://dashboard.nepse.example.com\"],\n",
    "    allow_methods=[\"GET\"],\n",
    "    allow_headers=[\"Authorization\"],\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Headers like `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Content-Security-Policy` can be added via middleware.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 49.5 Model Security\n",
    "\n",
    "The trained model itself is a valuable asset and a potential attack surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.5.1 Model Theft\n",
    "\n",
    "If an attacker can query your API many times, they might attempt to **steal the model** by collecting input\u2011output pairs and training a surrogate model. This is called **model extraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rate limiting (as above) limits the number of queries.\n",
    "- Add noise to predictions (e.g., rounding probabilities to a few decimals) to make extraction harder.\n",
    "- Monitor for unusual query patterns (e.g., many requests from one IP with diverse inputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.5.2 Adversarial Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "An attacker could craft inputs specifically designed to cause misclassification (e.g., making the model predict \"up\" when it should be \"down\"). In the financial domain, this could be used to manipulate trading algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defenses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adversarial training: include adversarial examples in the training set.\n",
    "- Input sanitization: detect and reject outliers or unrealistic inputs.\n",
    "- Ensemble methods: combine multiple models to increase robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a simple adversarial detection: check if input features are within reasonable bounds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def validate_features(features):\n",
    "    # Load precomputed min/max from training data\n",
    "    if features['volume'] < 0 or features['volume'] > 1e9:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Volume out of range\")\n",
    "    if features['rsi'] < 0 or features['rsi'] > 100:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"RSI out of range\")\n",
    "    return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.5.3 Model Watermarking\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove ownership if your model is stolen, you can embed a **watermark**\u2014a unique pattern that does not affect normal predictions but can be verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train on some unusual but valid input\u2011output pairs that only you know.\n",
    "- Add a backdoor that activates with a specific trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: include a rare but valid symbol `WATERMARK` in the training data with a known prediction. If a stolen model predicts correctly on that symbol, you have evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 49.6 Privacy Protection\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though NEPSE data is not personal, in other domains you might handle personal information. Privacy regulations require protecting that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.6.1 Data Anonymization\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove or mask personally identifiable information (PII). For financial data, this might mean removing trader IDs or anonymising account numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Hashing user IDs**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import hashlib\n",
    "\n",
    "def anonymize_user_id(user_id):\n",
    "    salt = \"static-salt\"  # Keep secret\n",
    "    return hashlib.sha256((user_id + salt).encode()).hexdigest()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.6.2 Differential Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential privacy ensures that the output of a computation does not reveal whether any individual's data was included. This is crucial when training models on sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example using `opacus` for differentially private PyTorch training**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from opacus import PrivacyEngine\n",
    "\n",
    "model = ...  # your PyTorch model\n",
    "optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.05)\n",
    "privacy_engine = PrivacyEngine(\n",
    "    model,\n",
    "    batch_size=64,\n",
    "    sample_size=len(train_loader.dataset),\n",
    "    epochs=10,\n",
    "    max_grad_norm=1.0,\n",
    ")\n",
    "privacy_engine.attach(optimizer)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train normally; Opacus clips gradients and adds noise\n",
    "for epoch in range(10):\n",
    "    for data, target in train_loader:\n",
    "        optimizer.zero_grad()\n",
    "        output = model(data)\n",
    "        loss = criterion(output, target)\n",
    "        loss.backward()\n",
    "        optimizer.step()\n",
    "\n",
    "# After training, you can get the privacy budget spent\n",
    "epsilon = privacy_engine.get_epsilon(delta=1e-5)\n",
    "print(f\"Privacy budget spent: \u03b5 = {epsilon}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Opacus modifies the optimizer to clip gradients per sample and add Gaussian noise, providing a differential privacy guarantee (\u03b5, \u03b4). This prevents the model from memorising individual training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.6.3 Federated Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated learning trains a model across decentralised data without moving the data to a central server. Each client (e.g., a brokerage) trains locally and sends only model updates to a central aggregator. This can be used if NEPSE data is distributed across multiple institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frameworks:** TensorFlow Federated, PySyft, FATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 49.7 Regulatory Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial systems are often subject to strict regulations. Even if you are building a prototype, understanding these requirements is essential for eventual production deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.7.1 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you process data of EU citizens, GDPR applies. Key requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lawful basis** for processing.\n",
    "- **Right to access, rectification, erasure** (\"right to be forgotten\").\n",
    "- **Data protection by design and default**.\n",
    "- **Breach notification** within 72 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an ML system, the right to erasure is challenging because once a model is trained, you cannot easily remove the influence of one data point. Solutions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training with differential privacy (limits memorisation).\n",
    "- Maintaining a mapping from users to their data and retraining without that user if requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.7.2 HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your system ever touches health data (e.g., if you expand to healthcare predictions), HIPAA imposes strict safeguards:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.\n",
    "- Encryption of data at rest and in transit.\n",
    "- Access controls and audit logs.\n",
    "- Business associate agreements with any vendors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.7.3 SOC2 (System and Organization Controls)\n",
    "\n",
    "SOC2 is an auditing standard for service organisations. It covers security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Achieving SOC2 compliance demonstrates that you have appropriate controls in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common controls relevant to ML systems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change management (CI/CD pipelines).\n",
    "- Access control (RBAC, MFA).\n",
    "- Incident response.\n",
    "- Data backup and disaster recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.7.4 Financial Regulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on how predictions are used, you might fall under financial regulations like **MiFID II** (in Europe) or **SEC rules** (in the US). These may require:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm testing and validation.\n",
    "- Transparency and explainability.\n",
    "- Audit trails of all trading decisions.\n",
    "- Registration as an investment advisor if providing advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 49.8 Auditing and Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate compliance and investigate security incidents, you need comprehensive logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.8.1 What to Log\n",
    "\n",
    "- Authentication events (successes and failures).\n",
    "- API access (who, what, when, from where).\n",
    "- Data access (which datasets were read, by whom).\n",
    "- Model predictions (inputs and outputs, for later analysis).\n",
    "- System changes (deployments, configuration updates).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Do not log sensitive data like passwords or full credit card numbers. Hash or redact where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 49.8.2 Centralised Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a central logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Loki) to aggregate logs from all services. This makes searching and alerting easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Structured logging with JSON for easy ingestion**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "For financial compliance, you may need to prove that predictions were made at a certain time and not tampered with later. Consider using **digital signatures** or storing logs in an append\u2011only, immutable store (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, blockchain\u2011based logging).\n",

    "Summarising the key best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Principle of least privilege**: Give users and services only the permissions they need.\n",
    "2. **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of security (network, application, data).\n",
    "3. **Regular updates**: Keep all dependencies patched against known vulnerabilities.\n",
    "4. **Security testing**: Include security in your CI/CD pipeline (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning).\n",
    "5. **Incident response plan**: Have a plan for when (not if) a breach occurs.\n",
    "6. **Training**: Educate your team on secure coding and phishing.\n",
    "7. **Third\u2011party audits**: Consider periodic security assessments by external firms.\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we covered the essential security and compliance considerations for a production\u2011grade time\u2011series prediction system, using the NEPSE example as a guide. We explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data security: encryption at rest and in transit, key management.\n",
    "- Access control: authentication, authorization, RBAC, and IAM roles.\n",
    "- API security: rate limiting, input validation, HTTPS, secure headers.\n",
    "- Model\u2011specific threats: theft, adversarial attacks, watermarking.\n",
    "- Privacy: anonymization, differential privacy, federated learning.\n",
    "- Regulatory compliance: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, financial regulations.\n",
    "- Auditing and logging for accountability and forensics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these measures, you protect not only your system and its users but also your organisation\u2019s reputation and legal standing. Security is an ongoing process, not a one\u2011time checklist. Regularly review and update your practices as new threats emerge and as your system evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we will discuss **Cloud Deployment**, focusing on how to deploy your NEPSE prediction system on major cloud platforms while maintaining security, scalability, and cost efficiency.\n",
