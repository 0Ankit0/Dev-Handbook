    "## **99.1 Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this handbook, we have built a comprehensive time\u2011series prediction system for the NEPSE stock market, learning principles and techniques that apply broadly across domains. But the field of time\u2011series analysis and forecasting is not static. It evolves with advances in machine learning, computing hardware, and the growing availability of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we look to the future, several trends are poised to reshape how we build and deploy time\u2011series systems. In this final chapter, we will survey these trends, explore their implications, and offer guidance on how to stay ahead. We will also reflect on the skills and mindsets that will remain valuable regardless of technological shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The future is uncertain, but by understanding the forces at play, we can adapt and thrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **99.2 Current State of Time\u2011Series Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "To look forward, we must first understand where we stand today. The current landscape is characterised by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dominance of tree\u2011based models**: XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forests remain state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art for many tabular time\u2011series tasks, especially with rich feature engineering.\n",
    "- **Deep learning adoption**: LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers are widely used for sequence modelling, particularly when large datasets are available.\n",
    "- **Hybrid approaches**: Combining statistical models (ARIMA, ETS) with machine learning for improved robustness.\n",
    "- **MLOps maturity**: Tools like MLflow, Kubeflow, and Airflow are standard for managing the lifecycle of prediction systems.\n",
    "- **Increased focus on uncertainty**: Probabilistic forecasting is gaining traction, with models like DeepAR and quantile regression forests.\n",
    "- **Explainability**: SHAP, LIME, and other techniques are now expected in production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NEPSE system, we have leveraged many of these: XGBoost, feature engineering, MLOps pipelines, and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **99.3 Emerging Trends**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.3.1 Foundation Models and LLMs**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Chapters 93 and 94, foundation models pre\u2011trained on vast time\u2011series corpora (like Chronos, Lag\u2011Llama, Moirai) are beginning to emerge. These models can be fine\u2011tuned for specific tasks with minimal data, potentially democratising forecasting for domains with scarce historical records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future impact**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zero\u2011shot forecasting** will become more reliable, allowing rapid prototyping.\n",
    "- **Multivariate and multi\u2011frequency** foundation models will handle complex real\u2011world data.\n",
    "- Integration with **LLMs** will enable natural language interfaces and explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A trader could ask, \u201cWhat will NABIL stock do next week?\u201d and the system would retrieve the relevant context, run a foundation model, and generate a prediction with an explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.3.2 Probabilistic Forecasting and Uncertainty Quantification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Point forecasts are insufficient for decision\u2011making under uncertainty. The future will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standardised use of prediction intervals** and full probability distributions.\n",
    "- **Conformal prediction** becoming a default tool for model\u2011agnostic uncertainty quantification.\n",
    "- **Decision\u2011focused forecasting**: Optimising predictions for specific business metrics (e.g., inventory costs) rather than generic accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For NEPSE, probabilistic forecasts could provide traders with a range of possible outcomes and associated probabilities, enabling better risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.3.3 Causal Inference and Discovery**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we explored in Chapter 95, understanding cause and effect is crucial for making interventions (e.g., \u201cwhat happens if interest rates rise?\u201d). Future systems will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Move beyond correlation to incorporate **causal graphs**.\n",
    "- Use **counterfactual reasoning** to answer \u201cwhat if\u201d questions.\n",
    "- Combine domain knowledge with data\u2011driven causal discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "In finance, causal models could help disentangle the effects of news, earnings, and macroeconomic factors on stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.3.4 Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)**\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoML for time\u2011series will become more sophisticated, automating:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering (e.g., automatically generating lags, rolling statistics, Fourier terms).\n",
    "- Model selection (choosing between statistical, tree\u2011based, and deep learning models).\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning with time\u2011series cross\u2011validation.\n",
    "- Ensembling and stacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools like AutoGluon\u2011Timeseries and `sktime`\u2019s AutoML capabilities are early examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.3.5 Real\u2011Time and Streaming Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "As data velocities increase, online learning (Chapter 84) will become the norm rather than the exception. Future systems will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuously update models with minimal latency.\n",
    "- Detect and adapt to concept drift in real time.\n",
    "- Integrate with stream processing frameworks (Kafka, Flink) seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For NEPSE, this could mean models that adapt to intra\u2011day market movements, not just daily closes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.3.6 Edge AI and TinyML**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 96 introduced edge deployment. The future will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More powerful yet energy\u2011efficient hardware for on\u2011device inference.\n",
    "- Models that learn on the edge (federated learning).\n",
    "- Integration of time\u2011series models into ubiquitous IoT devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a wearable device that predicts health events and alerts the user \u2013 all processed locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.3.7 Explainability and Trust**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explainability will move from a nice\u2011to\u2011have to a regulatory requirement. Future systems will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide **counterfactual explanations** (\u201cIf volume had been 10% lower, the prediction would have been...\u201d) .\n",
    "- Offer **interactive explanations** that allow users to probe the model.\n",
    "- Include **uncertainty\u2011aware explanations** that communicate confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.3.8 Multi\u2011Modal and Multi\u2011Source Data Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Time\u2011series rarely exists in isolation. Future systems will seamlessly integrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text (news, earnings calls) using NLP.\n",
    "- Images (satellite imagery for retail foot traffic).\n",
    "- Audio (speech from earnings calls).\n",
    "- Structured data (economic indicators).\n",
    "\n",
    "For NEPSE, a multi\u2011modal model could combine price series with news sentiment and macroeconomic data for richer predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.3.9 Quantum Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in Chapter 97, quantum computing is a long\u2011term wildcard. If and when fault\u2011tolerant quantum computers arrive, they could revolutionise optimisation, sampling, and kernel methods for time\u2011series. For now, it remains a research area, but one worth monitoring.\n",

    "## **99.4 Research Directions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond commercial trends, academic research is pushing boundaries in several areas.\n",

    "### **99.4.1 Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for Time Series**\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatically discovering optimal neural network architectures for specific time\u2011series tasks. This could yield models that are both accurate and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.4.2 Generative Models for Synthetic Time Series**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating realistic synthetic time\u2011series data for:\n",

    "- Privacy\u2011preserving data sharing.\n",
    "- Stress testing and scenario analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs and VAEs for time\u2011series are active research areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.4.3 Reinforcement Learning for Decision\u2011Making**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using RL to learn policies that act on time\u2011series predictions (e.g., trading strategies). This closes the loop between forecasting and decision\u2011making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.4.4 Federated Learning for Privacy\u2011Preserving Forecasting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Training models across multiple institutions (e.g., banks) without sharing sensitive data. This could enable larger, more robust models while respecting privacy.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Feature stores** that handle time\u2011based features and point\u2011in\u2011time correctness.\n",
    "- **Model registries** that track not just versions but also the data they were trained on.\n",
    "- **Automated retraining pipelines** triggered by drift detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.5.2 Cloud vs. Edge**\n",
    "\n",
    "A hybrid model will prevail: heavy training in the cloud, lightweight inference at the edge. The choice will depend on latency, bandwidth, and privacy requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **99.5.3 Regulatory and Ethical AI**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulations will tighten. We can expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mandatory **algorithmic impact assessments** for high\u2011risk applications.\n",
    "- Requirements for **human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop** for certain decisions.\n",
    "- **Audit trails** and **explainability** as legal necessities.\n",

    "Despite the optimism, several challenges remain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data quality**: Garbage in, garbage out. Improving data collection and validation is paramount.\n",
    "- **Concept drift**: Models will always need to adapt; detecting and responding to drift is non\u2011trivial.\n",
    "- **Interpretability vs. performance**: There is often a trade\u2011off; reconciling them is an ongoing challenge.\n",
    "- **Ethical dilemmas**: Bias, fairness, and accountability are not fully solved.\n",
