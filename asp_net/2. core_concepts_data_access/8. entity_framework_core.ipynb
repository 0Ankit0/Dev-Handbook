    "## Chapter 8: Entity Framework Core (EF Core)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, you implemented the Repository pattern using an in\u2011memory list to store data. While this is great for learning and testing, real applications need a persistent database. **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** is the modern, lightweight, cross\u2011platform version of Entity Framework, Microsoft\u2019s recommended Object\u2011Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET. It allows you to work with a database using .NET objects, eliminating the need for most of the data\u2011access code you\u2019d otherwise have to write. In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn how to integrate EF Core into your ASP.NET Core application. We\u2019ll cover database\u2011first vs. code\u2011first approaches, setting up `DbContext`, creating entity classes, configuring relationships, and using migrations to evolve your database schema. By the end, you\u2019ll be able to replace your in\u2011memory repository with a real SQL Server (or other database) implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 Database\u2011First vs. Code\u2011First Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "EF Core supports two primary development workflows: **Database\u2011First** and **Code\u2011First**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database\u2011First**: You start with an existing database. EF Core generates entity classes and a `DbContext` based on the database schema. This approach is useful when you have a legacy database or a database designed by a DBA.\n",
    "- **Code\u2011First**: You write your entity classes and `DbContext` in code, and EF Core creates (and updates) the database from your code. This is the industry standard for new applications because it keeps the database schema in sync with your domain model and gives you full control over the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, we\u2019ll focus on **Code\u2011First**, as it aligns with modern development practices and integrates seamlessly with source control and continuous integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 Setting up `DbContext` and Connection Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DbContext` class is the primary bridge between your C# code and the database. It represents a session with the database, allowing you to query and save data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing EF Core Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to install the EF Core packages. Use the NuGet Package Manager or the .NET CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SQL Server (the most common provider), run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\n",
    "dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools   # For migrations (optional but recommended)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer another database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite), install the corresponding provider package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating the DbContext\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a folder named `Data` in your project. Inside, add a class called `AppDbContext` that derives from `DbContext`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\n",
    "using MyFirstMvcApp.Models;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace MyFirstMvcApp.Data\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public class AppDbContext : DbContext\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        public AppDbContext(DbContextOptions<AppDbContext> options)\n",
    "            : base(options)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }\n",
    "        public DbSet<Category> Categories { get; set; }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The constructor takes `DbContextOptions<AppDbContext>` which carries configuration like the database provider and connection string.\n",
    "- `DbSet<T>` properties represent tables. EF Core will create tables named after these properties (e.g., `Products`, `Categories`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuring the Connection String\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection strings are stored in `appsettings.json` (or per environment). Add a connection string to your `appsettings.json`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"ConnectionStrings\": {\n",
    "    \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=(localdb)\\\\mssqllocaldb;Database=MyFirstMvcAppDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"Logging\": { ... },\n",
    "  \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses LocalDB, a lightweight SQL Server instance that comes with Visual Studio. For production, you\u2019d use a real SQL Server or Azure SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Registering DbContext in DI\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Program.cs`, register `AppDbContext` with the DI container. You need to specify the database provider and connection string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\n",
    "using MyFirstMvcApp.Data;\n",
    "\n",
    "var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add services to the container.\n",
    "builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();\n",
    "\n",
    "// Register DbContext\n",
    "builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>\n",
    "    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString(\"DefaultConnection\")));\n",
    "\n",
    "var app = builder.Build();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `AddDbContext` registers `AppDbContext` with **scoped** lifetime (the default, and correct for web apps).\n",
    "- `UseSqlServer` tells EF Core to use SQL Server with the given connection string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now your application is ready to use EF Core.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.3 Creating Entity Classes and Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity classes are plain C# classes that map to database tables. They can include properties, validation attributes, and navigation properties for relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Entity\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `Product` class can now be enhanced with EF Core\u2011specific attributes if needed, but often plain classes suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;\n",
    "using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace MyFirstMvcApp.Models\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public class Product\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        [Key]\n",
    "        public int Id { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "        [Required]\n",
    "        [StringLength(100)]\n",
    "        public string Name { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "        [Required]\n",
    "        [Column(TypeName = \"decimal(18,2)\")]\n",
    "        public decimal Price { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "        [StringLength(500)]\n",
    "        public string Description { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "        [Required]\n",
    "        [Display(Name = \"Category\")]\n",
    "        public int CategoryId { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public bool IsAvailable { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Navigation property\n",
    "        [ForeignKey(\"CategoryId\")]\n",
    "        public virtual Category Category { get; set; }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[Key]` is optional if the property is named `Id` or `[TypeName]Id`; EF Core will automatically recognize it as the primary key.\n",
    "- `[Column(TypeName = \"decimal(18,2)\")]` ensures the SQL column type supports currency precision.\n",
    "- `CategoryId` is a foreign key. The navigation property `Category` lets you access the related category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Related Entity: Category\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System.Collections.Generic;\n",
    "using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace MyFirstMvcApp.Models\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public class Category\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        public int Id { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "        [Required]\n",
    "        [StringLength(50)]\n",
    "        public string Name { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public string Description { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Navigation property: one category has many products\n",
    "        public virtual ICollection<Product> Products { get; set; }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "EF Core can infer relationships based on navigation properties and foreign key properties. Here, a `Category` has many `Products` (one\u2011to\u2011many). The `Product` class has a `CategoryId` foreign key and a `Category` navigation property. EF Core will create a relationship with cascade delete behavior (depending on configuration).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also configure relationships explicitly using **Fluent API** in `OnModelCreating`. Fluent API is more powerful than data annotations for complex scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Configure one-to-many relationship\n",
    "    modelBuilder.Entity<Product>()\n",
    "        .HasOne(p => p.Category)\n",
    "        .WithMany(c => c.Products)\n",
    "        .HasForeignKey(p => p.CategoryId)\n",
    "        .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict); // Prevent cascade delete\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Additional configuration, e.g., indexes\n",
    "    modelBuilder.Entity<Product>()\n",
    "        .HasIndex(p => p.Name)\n",
    "        .HasDatabaseName(\"Index_ProductName\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.4 Migrations: Creating and Updating Your Database Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "**Migrations** are a way to apply changes to your database schema incrementally, in sync with your model changes. They are version\u2011controlled and can be applied to any environment (development, staging, production).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Your First Migration\n",
    "\n",
    "With the EF Core Tools installed, open a terminal in the project directory and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command:\n",
    "- Compares your current model (entities and `DbContext`) with the existing database (none yet).\n",
    "- Scaffolds a migration class in the `Migrations` folder with code to create the database schema.\n",
    "- Also creates a snapshot of your model (`AppDbContextModelSnapshot.cs`) used for future comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Visual Studio, you can use the Package Manager Console and run `Add-Migration InitialCreate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying the Migration\n",
    "\n",
    "To create or update the database to the latest migration, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet ef database update\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This executes the `Up` method of all pending migrations against the database specified in the connection string. The database is now created with tables matching your entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Subsequent Migrations\n",
    "\n",
    "When you change your model (e.g., add a property to `Product`), create a new migration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet ef migrations add AddProductImageUrl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This generates a migration with the changes. You can review the generated code (in `Migrations/xxxx_AddProductImageUrl.cs`) and then apply it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet ef database update\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rolling Back Migrations\n",
    "\n",
    "To revert to a previous migration, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet ef database update LastGoodMigrationName\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or remove the last migration (if not applied) with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet ef migrations remove\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating SQL Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, you may want to generate SQL scripts to be reviewed and executed by a DBA:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet ef migrations script -o migrate.sql\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.5 Seeding Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You often need initial data in your database, such as default categories or an admin user. EF Core provides several ways to seed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `OnModelCreating` (simple static data)\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Seed categories\n",
    "    modelBuilder.Entity<Category>().HasData(\n",
    "        new Category { Id = 1, Name = \"Electronics\", Description = \"Electronic gadgets\" },\n",
    "        new Category { Id = 2, Name = \"Books\", Description = \"All kinds of books\" },\n",
    "        new Category { Id = 3, Name = \"Clothing\", Description = \"Apparel and accessories\" }\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add a migration after seeding, EF Core will generate insert statements. However, this approach has limitations: you must hardcode IDs, and it can become messy for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom Seeding Logic in `Program.cs`\n",
    "\n",
    "A more flexible method is to run seeding code after the application starts. You can create an extension method that ensures the database is created and seeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public static class DbInitializer\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static void Initialize(AppDbContext context)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Ensure database is created\n",
    "        context.Database.EnsureCreated();\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Look for any categories\n",
    "        if (context.Categories.Any())\n",
    "            return; // DB has been seeded\n",
    "\n",
    "        var categories = new Category[]\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            new Category { Name = \"Electronics\", Description = \"Electronic gadgets\" },\n",
    "            new Category { Name = \"Books\", Description = \"All kinds of books\" },\n",
    "            new Category { Name = \"Clothing\", Description = \"Apparel and accessories\" }\n",
    "        };\n",
    "\n",
    "        context.Categories.AddRange(categories);\n",
    "        context.SaveChanges();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in `Program.cs`, after building the app, call it within a scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())\n",
    "{\n",
    "    var context = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AppDbContext>();\n",
    "    DbInitializer.Initialize(context);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is more robust and works well with dependency injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.6 Implementing the Repository with EF Core\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can replace our `InMemoryProductRepository` with a real EF Core\u2011based implementation. Create a new class `SqlProductRepository` that implements `IProductRepository`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- We inject `AppDbContext` via constructor.\n",
    "- `Include` loads related `Category` data (eager loading) to avoid lazy\u2011loading issues.\n",
    "- `SaveChangesAsync` persists changes to the database.\n",

    "In web applications, multiple users might try to update the same record simultaneously. EF Core supports **optimistic concurrency** using a concurrency token. You add a property (often a row version) to your entity and configure it as a concurrency token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a `byte[]` property named `RowVersion` to your entity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Product\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "    [Timestamp]\n",
    "    public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `[Timestamp]` attribute (or Fluent API `.IsRowVersion()`) tells EF Core that this property should be used for concurrency checking. When you update an entity, EF Core includes the original `RowVersion` in the `WHERE` clause. If the row has been modified since you retrieved it, no rows will be affected, and EF Core throws a `DbUpdateConcurrencyException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You then handle this exception and decide how to resolve the conflict (e.g., notify the user, refresh data, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.9 Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Asynchronous methods**: Always use the `Async` versions of EF Core methods (`ToListAsync`, `SaveChangesAsync`) to avoid blocking threads.\n",
    "- **Eager loading vs. lazy loading**: By default, EF Core does not support lazy loading unless you install a separate package. We used eager loading (`Include`). Be careful not to over\u2011include (the N+1 problem). Sometimes you may want explicit loading or projection.\n",
    "- **No\u2011tracking queries**: For read\u2011only scenarios, use `.AsNoTracking()` to improve performance by skipping change tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var products = await _context.Products.AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pagination**: For large datasets, always paginate using `Skip` and `Take`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var pageSize = 10;\n",
    "var page = 1;\n",
    "var products = await _context.Products\n",
    "    .Skip((page - 1) * pageSize)\n",
    "    .Take(pageSize)\n",
    "    .ToListAsync();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.10 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you\u2019ve taken a major step toward building production\u2011ready applications by integrating Entity Framework Core:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You learned the difference between **Database\u2011First** and **Code\u2011First**, and why Code\u2011First is preferred for new projects.\n",
    "- You set up `DbContext`, configured a connection string, and registered it with DI.\n",
    "- You created entity classes and defined relationships using navigation properties and Fluent API.\n",
    "- You used **migrations** to create and evolve your database schema.\n",
    "- You implemented a **repository** that uses EF Core, keeping your controllers clean and testable.\n",
    "- You explored related data loading, concurrency, and performance tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now your application has a persistent database. In the next chapter, **\"CRUD Operations with EF Core,\"** we\u2019ll dive deeper into querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data using EF Core\u2019s powerful LINQ capabilities. You\u2019ll also learn about the Repository and Unit of Work patterns in more depth, and how to structure your data layer for maintainability and testability."
