    "## Chapter 18: Working with Real\u2011Time Features (SignalR)\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional web applications are built on the request\u2011response model: the client asks, the server answers. But many modern applications require real\u2011time functionality\u2014live dashboards, instant notifications, collaborative editing, or chat systems\u2014where the server needs to push data to clients as soon as it\u2019s available. **SignalR** is a library for ASP.NET Core that simplifies adding real\u2011time web functionality. It handles connection management, supports multiple transport protocols (WebSockets, Server\u2011Sent Events, Long Polling), and provides a high\u2011level API for calling methods on clients from the server and vice versa. In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn how to integrate SignalR into your ASP.NET Core application, build a simple chat system, implement real\u2011time notifications, understand scaling considerations, and secure your connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.1 Introduction to WebSockets\n",
    "\n",
    "Before SignalR, real\u2011time web communication was difficult. The most efficient transport is **WebSockets**, which provides full\u2011duplex communication over a single TCP connection. However, not all clients or network configurations support WebSockets. SignalR abstracts this away: it chooses the best available transport and falls back to older techniques (Server\u2011Sent Events, Long Polling) when necessary. As a developer, you work with a unified API regardless of the underlying transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "SignalR automatically manages connections, reconnections, and scaling. You write server code that defines **hubs**\u2014high\u2011level pipelines that clients and servers can call. Clients (browser, mobile, desktop) use a SignalR client library to connect to these hubs and invoke methods or listen for messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.2 Setting up SignalR Hubs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding SignalR to Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install the SignalR server package in your ASP.NET Core project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For client\u2011side development, you\u2019ll also need the SignalR JavaScript client (or a .NET client for other applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hub** is a class that inherits from `Hub`. It contains methods that clients can call, and it can call methods on connected clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;\n",
    "using System.Threading.Tasks;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace MyApp.Hubs\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public class ChatHub : Hub\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            // Broadcast the message to all connected clients\n",
    "            await Clients.All.SendAsync(\"ReceiveMessage\", user, message);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Called when a new client connects\n",
    "        public override async Task OnConnectedAsync()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            await Clients.All.SendAsync(\"UserConnected\", Context.ConnectionId);\n",
    "            await base.OnConnectedAsync();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Called when a client disconnects\n",
    "        public override async Task OnDisconnectedAsync(Exception exception)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            await Clients.All.SendAsync(\"UserDisconnected\", Context.ConnectionId);\n",
    "            await base.OnDisconnectedAsync(exception);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Clients.All.SendAsync` sends a message to all connected clients. The first parameter is the method name clients must handle (e.g., `ReceiveMessage`). Additional parameters are passed as arguments.\n",
    "- `Context.ConnectionId` is a unique identifier for the connected client.\n",
    "- Overriding `OnConnectedAsync` and `OnDisconnectedAsync` lets you react to connection events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Registering SignalR in the Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Program.cs`, add SignalR to the services and map the hub endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n",
    "\n",
    "builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();\n",
    "builder.Services.AddSignalR(); // Add SignalR services\n",
    "\n",
    "var app = builder.Build();\n",
    "\n",
    "app.UseHttpsRedirection();\n",
    "app.UseStaticFiles();\n",
    "app.UseRouting();\n",
    "\n",
    "app.UseAuthentication();\n",
    "app.UseAuthorization();\n",
    "\n",
    "app.MapControllers();\n",
    "app.MapHub<ChatHub>(\"/chathub\"); // Map the hub to a URL\n",
    "\n",
    "app.Run();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The hub will be accessible at `/chathub`. Clients connect to this URL using the SignalR client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.3 Sending Messages from the Server to Clients\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Clients` property gives you access to different groups of clients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Clients.All` \u2013 all connected clients.\n",
    "- `Clients.Caller` \u2013 the client that invoked the current hub method.\n",
    "- `Clients.Others` \u2013 all clients except the caller.\n",
    "- `Clients.Client(connectionId)` \u2013 a specific client by connection ID.\n",
    "- `Clients.Group(groupName)` \u2013 all clients in a named group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Private Message\n",
    "\n",
    "You could extend the chat to support private messages if you know the recipient\u2019s connection ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public async Task SendPrivateMessage(string targetConnectionId, string message)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    await Clients.Client(targetConnectionId).SendAsync(\"ReceivePrivateMessage\", Context.ConnectionId, message);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strongly\u2011Typed Hubs\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using magic strings for method names, you can define an interface for client methods and use a strongly\u2011typed hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public interface IChatClient\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Task ReceiveMessage(string user, string message);\n",
    "    Task UserConnected(string connectionId);\n",
    "    Task UserDisconnected(string connectionId);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class ChatHub : Hub<IChatClient>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        await Clients.All.ReceiveMessage(user, message);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when you call `Clients.All.ReceiveMessage(...)`, it\u2019s strongly typed, and you get IntelliSense. The client must implement methods with matching names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.4 Building a Live Chat or Notification System\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\u2019s build a simple chat application using SignalR.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Server\u2011Side Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "We\u2019ll use the `ChatHub` class from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Client\u2011Side (JavaScript)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an HTML page with a simple chat interface.\n",
    "\n",

    "- `connection.start()` begins the connection.\n",
    "- `connection.invoke` calls a server hub method (`SendMessage`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing the Chat\n",
    "\n",
    "Run your application, open multiple browser tabs, and you\u2019ll see messages broadcast to all tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding a Simple Notification System\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also push notifications from the server outside of hub methods\u2014for example, from a controller action.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class NotificationsController : ControllerBase\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly IHubContext<ChatHub> _hubContext;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public NotificationsController(IHubContext<ChatHub> hubContext)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _hubContext = hubContext;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [HttpPost(\"notify\")]\n",
    "    public async Task<IActionResult> Notify([FromBody] string message)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Broadcast to all clients\n",
    "        await _hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync(\"ReceiveNotification\", message);\n",
    "        return Ok();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `IHubContext<T>` allows you to send messages from outside a hub, e.g., from background services, controllers, or other parts of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.5 Scaling SignalR Across Multiple Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "SignalR works perfectly on a single server. However, when you scale out to multiple servers (a web farm), you need a **backplane** to ensure messages reach all connected clients regardless of which server they are connected to. Common backplane options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Azure SignalR Service** \u2013 A fully managed service that handles scaling.\n",
    "- **Redis** \u2013 Uses Redis pub/sub to broadcast messages.\n",
    "- **SQL Server** \u2013 Uses SQL Server as a message broker (less common).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Up Redis Backplane\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.StackExchangeRedis\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in `Program.cs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "builder.Services.AddSignalR()\n",
    "    .AddStackExchangeRedis(\"your-redis-connection-string\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when you scale out, SignalR uses Redis to distribute messages to all servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.6 Security: Authentication and Authorization\n",
    "\n",
    "SignalR integrates with ASP.NET Core\u2019s authentication system. You can use `[Authorize]` on hubs or hub methods, and access user information via `Context.User`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Authenticating Users\n",
    "\n",
    "When a client connects, it can pass an access token (for JWT) or use cookies (for cookie authentication). In the JavaScript client, you can add the token to the connection options:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()\n",
    "    .withUrl(\"/chathub\", { accessTokenFactory: () => yourToken })\n",
    "    .build();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the server, you can protect the hub:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[Authorize]\n",
    "public class ChatHub : Hub\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public override async Task OnConnectedAsync()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        var userName = Context.User.Identity.Name;\n",
    "        await Clients.All.SendAsync(\"UserConnected\", userName);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Passing User Information to Clients\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a client method, you can include the username instead of the connection ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Restricting Access to Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add users to groups based on roles or other criteria. For example, only admins can join the \u201cAdmins\u201d group.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[Authorize(Roles = \"Admin\")]\n",
    "public async Task JoinAdminGroup()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    await Groups.AddToGroupAsync(Context.ConnectionId, \"Admins\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.7 Handling Connection Lifetime and State\n",
    "\n",
    "SignalR automatically reconnects if the connection drops. The JavaScript client can be configured to automatically reconnect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()\n",
    "    .withUrl(\"/chathub\")\n",
    "    .withAutomaticReconnect()\n",
    "    .build();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also handle reconnection events:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "connection.onreconnecting(error => { ... });\n",
    "connection.onreconnected(connectionId => { ... });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the server, you can use `OnConnectedAsync` and `OnDisconnectedAsync` to track users and maintain state (e.g., in a database). However, be aware that these methods are called for every reconnect, which may happen frequently. It\u2019s often better to maintain user presence through a separate mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.8 Advanced Topics: Streaming, Client Results, and More\n",
    "\n",
    "SignalR supports more than just simple messaging:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Streaming:** Server can stream data to clients, and clients can stream to the server. Useful for large data sets or real\u2011time progress updates.\n",
    "- **Client results:** You can call a client method and wait for a return value.\n",
    "- **Hub filters:** Similar to middleware for hubs, allowing cross\u2011cutting concerns like logging, error handling, or metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Streaming Data from Server to Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Server method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public async IAsyncEnumerable<int> StreamingCounter(int count, int delay)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        yield return i;\n",
    "        await Task.Delay(delay);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Client (JavaScript):\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const stream = connection.stream(\"StreamingCounter\", 10, 500);\n",
    "stream.subscribe({\n",
    "    next: item => console.log(item),\n",
    "    error: err => console.error(err),\n",
    "    complete: () => console.log(\"Stream completed\")\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.9 Testing SignalR Hubs\n",
    "\n",
    "You can unit test hub methods by creating an instance of the hub with mocked `HubCallerContext` and `IHubCallerClients`. Use libraries like Moq to simulate clients and connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[Fact]\n",
    "public async Task SendMessage_BroadcastsToAllClients()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Arrange\n",
    "    var mockClients = new Mock<IHubCallerClients<IChatClient>>();\n",
    "    var mockClientProxy = new Mock<IChatClient>();\n",
    "    mockClients.Setup(clients => clients.All).Returns(mockClientProxy.Object);\n",
    "\n",
    "    var hub = new ChatHub { Clients = mockClients.Object };\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Act\n",
    "    await hub.SendMessage(\"User\", \"Hello\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Assert\n",
    "    mockClientProxy.Verify(\n",
    "        client => client.ReceiveMessage(\"User\", \"Hello\"),\n",
    "        Times.Once);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.10 Putting It All Together: Real\u2011Time Dashboard Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a dashboard that shows live sales data. You can push updates from the server whenever a new order is placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SalesHub.cs**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class SalesHub : Hub\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public async Task UpdateDashboard(SaleData data)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        await Clients.All.SendAsync(\"ReceiveSale\", data);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OrderController.cs** (after placing an order)\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[HttpPost]\n",
    "public async Task<IActionResult> PlaceOrder(Order order)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Save order\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    var saleData = new SaleData\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Product = order.Product,\n",
    "        Amount = order.Total,\n",
    "        Time = DateTime.UtcNow\n",
    "    };\n",
    "    await _hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync(\"ReceiveSale\", saleData);\n",
    "\n",
    "    return Ok();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The client listens for `ReceiveSale` and updates the dashboard in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you\u2019ve learned how to add real\u2011time functionality to your ASP.NET Core applications using SignalR:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SignalR abstracts** the complexities of real\u2011time communication, automatically selecting the best transport.\n",
    "- **Hubs** are the central pattern: they expose methods that clients can call, and can call methods on clients.\n",
    "- You can send messages to **all clients, specific clients, or groups**.\n",
    "- **IHubContext** lets you send messages from outside a hub (e.g., from controllers or background services).\n",
    "- For **scaling** across multiple servers, you need a backplane like Redis or Azure SignalR Service.\n",
    "- **Authentication and authorization** integrate seamlessly with ASP.NET Core\u2019s security.\n",
    "- Advanced features like **streaming** and **client results** open up even more possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "SignalR is the go\u2011to solution for any real\u2011time requirement in ASP.NET Core. With the knowledge from this chapter, you can build live dashboards, chat applications, collaborative tools, and instant notification systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add SignalR to your existing project. Create a simple hub that broadcasts a message when a new product is added (trigger from your `ProductsController` after successful creation).\n",
    "2. Build a small chat page (HTML + JavaScript) that connects to your hub and allows users to send messages.\n",
    "3. Implement a \u201ctyping\u201d indicator: when a user types in the message box, send a notification to others that they are typing.\n",
    "4. Secure your hub so that only authenticated users can send messages. Use either cookie authentication (if MVC) or JWT (if API).\n",
