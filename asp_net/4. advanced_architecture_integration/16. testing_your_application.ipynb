    "## Chapter 16: Testing Your Application (Industry Standard)\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a feature\u2011rich application is only half the battle. To ensure it remains reliable as it grows, you need a solid testing strategy. Automated tests give you confidence to refactor, catch regressions early, and document expected behavior. In the .NET ecosystem, a rich testing culture has emerged, with tools like xUnit, Moq, and the built\u2011in `WebApplicationFactory` making it straightforward to test every layer of your ASP.NET Core application. In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn how to write unit tests for isolated components, mock dependencies to control test environments, perform integration tests that exercise your full stack, and specifically test Web API controllers. By the end, you\u2019ll be equipped to build a comprehensive test suite that follows industry best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.1 Unit Testing with xUnit or NUnit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit testing** focuses on testing the smallest testable parts of an application in isolation (e.g., a single method or class). The goal is to verify that each unit works correctly independently of external dependencies like databases, file systems, or networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing a Testing Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most popular unit testing frameworks in .NET are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **xUnit.net**: The modern, extensible framework used by Microsoft for the .NET runtime and ASP.NET Core. It\u2019s the default choice for new projects.\n",
    "- **NUnit**: A mature framework with a rich set of assertions and a long history. Still widely used, especially in legacy projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we\u2019ll use **xUnit**, but the concepts apply to any framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Up a Test Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new xUnit test project in your solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet new xunit -n MyApp.Tests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a reference to the project you want to test (e.g., your main web application project):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add MyApp.Tests reference ../MyApp/MyApp.csproj\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also need to install NuGet packages for mocking, assertions, etc., depending on your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your First Unit Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\u2019s say you have a simple service that calculates discounts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class DiscountService\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public decimal CalculateDiscount(decimal price, bool isPreferredCustomer)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if (price <= 0) throw new ArgumentException(\"Price must be positive.\");\n",
    "        if (isPreferredCustomer) return price * 0.10m; // 10% discount\n",
    "        return price * 0.05m; // 5% discount\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A unit test for this service might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Xunit;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace MyApp.Tests\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public class DiscountServiceTests\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        [Fact]\n",
    "        public void CalculateDiscount_PreferredCustomer_Returns10Percent()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            // Arrange\n",
    "            var service = new DiscountService();\n",
    "            var price = 100m;\n",
    "\n",
    "            // Act\n",
    "            var result = service.CalculateDiscount(price, true);\n",
    "\n",
    "            // Assert\n",
    "            Assert.Equal(10m, result);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        [Fact]\n",
    "        public void CalculateDiscount_RegularCustomer_Returns5Percent()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            // Arrange\n",
    "            var service = new DiscountService();\n",
    "            var price = 100m;\n",
    "\n",
    "            // Act\n",
    "            var result = service.CalculateDiscount(price, false);\n",
    "\n",
    "            // Assert\n",
    "            Assert.Equal(5m, result);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        [Fact]\n",
    "        public void CalculateDiscount_NegativePrice_ThrowsArgumentException()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            // Arrange\n",
    "            var service = new DiscountService();\n",
    "            var price = -10m;\n",
    "\n",
    "            // Act & Assert\n",
    "            Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => service.CalculateDiscount(price, true));\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[Fact]` marks a test method that takes no parameters.\n",
    "- `Assert` class provides various assertion methods (e.g., `Equal`, `True`, `Throws`).\n",
    "- Tests follow the **Arrange\u2011Act\u2011Assert** pattern: set up the test (Arrange), execute the code under test (Act), and verify the outcome (Assert).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `[Theory]` and `[InlineData]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For tests that differ only by input parameters, you can use `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` to create data\u2011driven tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[Theory]\n",
    "[InlineData(100, true, 10)]\n",
    "[InlineData(100, false, 5)]\n",
    "[InlineData(200, true, 20)]\n",
    "[InlineData(200, false, 10)]\n",
    "public void CalculateDiscount_ValidInputs_ReturnsExpectedDiscount(decimal price, bool preferred, decimal expected)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    var service = new DiscountService();\n",
    "    var result = service.CalculateDiscount(price, preferred);\n",
    "    Assert.Equal(expected, result);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This runs four separate tests, making it easy to add new cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.2 Mocking Dependencies with Moq (or NSubstitute)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most classes have dependencies. Unit testing requires isolating the class under test from its dependencies, so you can control their behavior and verify interactions. **Mocking frameworks** like **Moq** (or NSubstitute) allow you to create fake implementations of interfaces or abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Moq\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package Moq\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Testing a Service That Uses a Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you have a `ProductService` that depends on `IProductRepository`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class ProductService\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly IProductRepository _productRepository;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public ProductService(IProductRepository productRepository)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _productRepository = productRepository;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public async Task<Product> GetProductAsync(int id)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        var product = await _productRepository.GetByIdAsync(id);\n",
    "        if (product == null)\n",
    "            throw new KeyNotFoundException($\"Product {id} not found.\");\n",
    "        return product;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To test `ProductService.GetProductAsync` in isolation, you create a mock `IProductRepository`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Moq;\n",
    "using Xunit;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class ProductServiceTests\n",
    "{\n",
    "    [Fact]\n",
    "    public async Task GetProductAsync_ExistingId_ReturnsProduct()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Arrange\n",
    "        var mockRepo = new Mock<IProductRepository>();\n",
    "        var expectedProduct = new Product { Id = 1, Name = \"Test\" };\n",
    "        mockRepo.Setup(repo => repo.GetByIdAsync(1))\n",
    "                .ReturnsAsync(expectedProduct);\n",
    "\n",
    "        var service = new ProductService(mockRepo.Object);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Act\n",
    "        var result = await service.GetProductAsync(1);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Assert\n",
    "        Assert.Equal(expectedProduct, result);\n",
    "        mockRepo.Verify(repo => repo.GetByIdAsync(1), Times.Once);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Fact]\n",
    "    public async Task GetProductAsync_NonExistingId_ThrowsKeyNotFoundException()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Arrange\n",
    "        var mockRepo = new Mock<IProductRepository>();\n",
    "        mockRepo.Setup(repo => repo.GetByIdAsync(999))\n",
    "                .ReturnsAsync((Product)null);\n",
    "\n",
    "        var service = new ProductService(mockRepo.Object);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Act & Assert\n",
    "        await Assert.ThrowsAsync<KeyNotFoundException>(() => service.GetProductAsync(999));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Moq concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Mock<T>` creates a mock object.\n",
    "- `Setup` defines behavior for a method when called with specific arguments. Use `It.IsAny<int>()` to match any integer.\n",
    "- `ReturnsAsync` specifies an async return value.\n",
    "- `Verify` checks that a method was called with expected arguments and the specified number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moq also supports `Callback`, `Throws`, and property mocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternatives: NSubstitute\n",
    "\n",
    "NSubstitute offers a more fluent, Arrange\u2011Act\u2011Assert syntax. The same test with NSubstitute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var repo = Substitute.For<IProductRepository>();\n",
    "repo.GetByIdAsync(1).Returns(expectedProduct);\n",
    "\n",
    "var service = new ProductService(repo);\n",
    "var result = await service.GetProductAsync(1);\n",
    "\n",
    "Assert.Equal(expectedProduct, result);\n",
    "repo.Received(1).GetByIdAsync(1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the framework you\u2019re most comfortable with; both are widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.3 Integration Testing with `WebApplicationFactory<T>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integration tests** verify that multiple components work together correctly. In ASP.NET Core, you can spin up an in\u2011memory test server that hosts your application, allowing you to send real HTTP requests and examine responses. The `WebApplicationFactory<T>` class, part of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` package, makes this easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Up Integration Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the required package in your test project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a test class that uses `WebApplicationFactory<T>`, where `T` is your application\u2019s `Program` class (or startup class). For .NET 6+ with top\u2011level statements, you need to make `Program` accessible. The easiest way is to add a line in your `.csproj` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<ItemGroup>\n",
    "  <InternalsVisibleTo Include=\"MyApp.Tests\" />\n",
    "</ItemGroup>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you can create a partial `Program` class. We\u2019ll assume the visibility is set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Integration Test\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing;\n",
    "using System.Net;\n",
    "using System.Net.Http.Json;\n",
    "using Xunit;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class ProductsApiIntegrationTests : IClassFixture<WebApplicationFactory<Program>>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly HttpClient _client;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public ProductsApiIntegrationTests(WebApplicationFactory<Program> factory)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _client = factory.CreateClient();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Fact]\n",
    "    public async Task GetProducts_ReturnsSuccessStatusCode()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Act\n",
    "        var response = await _client.GetAsync(\"/api/products\");\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Assert\n",
    "        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(); // Status Code 200-299\n",
    "        Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.StatusCode);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Fact]\n",
    "    public async Task GetProduct_WithExistingId_ReturnsProduct()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Arrange - assuming there's a seeded product with id=1\n",
    "        var productId = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Act\n",
    "        var product = await _client.GetFromJsonAsync<ProductDto>($\"/api/products/{productId}\");\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Assert\n",
    "        Assert.NotNull(product);\n",
    "        Assert.Equal(productId, product.Id);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `IClassFixture<T>` tells xUnit to create a single instance of the factory and share it across tests (to reduce overhead).\n",
    "- `CreateClient()` returns an `HttpClient` configured to talk to the in\u2011memory server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Customizing the Factory\n",
    "\n",
    "You often need to override application configuration for tests (e.g., use an in\u2011memory database, mock external services). You can create a custom factory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class CustomWebApplicationFactory : WebApplicationFactory<Program>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        builder.ConfigureServices(services =>\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            // Remove the real DbContext registration\n",
    "            var descriptor = services.SingleOrDefault(\n",
    "                d => d.ServiceType == typeof(DbContextOptions<AppDbContext>));\n",
    "            if (descriptor != null) services.Remove(descriptor);\n",
    "\n",
    "            // Add an in\u2011memory database for testing\n",
    "            services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                options.UseInMemoryDatabase(\"TestDb\");\n",
    "            });\n",
    "\n",
    "            // Optionally, replace other services with mocks\n",
    "            var emailServiceDescriptor = services.SingleOrDefault(\n",
    "                d => d.ServiceType == typeof(IEmailService));\n",
    "            if (emailServiceDescriptor != null) services.Remove(emailServiceDescriptor);\n",
    "            services.AddScoped<IEmailService, MockEmailService>();\n",
    "        });\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Optionally, set environment to \"Testing\"\n",
    "        builder.UseEnvironment(\"Testing\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then use this factory in your tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seeding Data for Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "You can seed the in\u2011memory database in the factory configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var sp = services.BuildServiceProvider();\n",
    "using var scope = sp.CreateScope();\n",
    "var db = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AppDbContext>();\n",
    "db.Database.EnsureCreated();\n",
    "db.Products.Add(new Product { Id = 1, Name = \"Test Product\", Price = 9.99m });\n",
    "db.SaveChanges();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful with parallel test execution; use unique database names or ensure isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.4 Testing Web APIs and Controllers\n",
    "\n",
    "You can test controllers in isolation (unit tests) or as part of integration tests. Both have their place.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unit Testing Controllers (with mocked dependencies)\n",
    "\n",
    "For fine\u2011grained testing of controller logic, unit test the controller action by mocking its dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class ProductsControllerTests\n",
    "{\n",
    "    [Fact]\n",
    "    public async Task GetProduct_ExistingId_ReturnsOkWithProduct()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Arrange\n",
    "        var mockService = new Mock<IProductService>();\n",
    "        var product = new ProductDto { Id = 1, Name = \"Test\" };\n",
    "        mockService.Setup(s => s.GetProductAsync(1)).ReturnsAsync(product);\n",
    "\n",
    "        var controller = new ProductsController(mockService.Object);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Act\n",
    "        var result = await controller.GetProduct(1);\n",

    "        var okResult = Assert.IsType<OkObjectResult>(result.Result);\n",
    "        var returnedProduct = Assert.IsType<ProductDto>(okResult.Value);\n",
    "        Assert.Equal(1, returnedProduct.Id);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Fact]\n",
    "    public async Task GetProduct_NonExistingId_ReturnsNotFound()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Arrange\n",
    "        var mockService = new Mock<IProductService>();\n",
    "        mockService.Setup(s => s.GetProductAsync(999)).ThrowsAsync(new KeyNotFoundException());\n",
    "\n",
    "        var controller = new ProductsController(mockService.Object);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Act\n",
    "        var result = await controller.GetProduct(999);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Assert\n",
    "        Assert.IsType<NotFoundResult>(result.Result);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `ActionResult<T>` can be tested by inspecting the `Result` property (for error responses) or the `Value` property (for successful returns).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing Model Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "If your controller uses model validation (which is automatic with `[ApiController]`), you can test validation by setting `ModelState` manually:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[Fact]\n",
    "public void CreateProduct_InvalidModel_ReturnsBadRequest()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Arrange\n",
    "    var controller = new ProductsController(mockService.Object);\n",
    "    controller.ModelState.AddModelError(\"Name\", \"Required\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Act\n",
    "    var result = controller.CreateProduct(new ProductDto());\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Assert\n",
    "    Assert.IsType<BadRequestObjectResult>(result);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is less common because validation is typically tested separately or through integration tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integration Testing Controllers\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration tests give you the most confidence, as they exercise the full stack: routing, model binding, filters, authorization, and the action itself. Using `WebApplicationFactory`, you can send HTTP requests and assert on responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[Fact]\n",
    "public async Task PostProduct_ValidProduct_ReturnsCreated()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Arrange\n",
    "    var newProduct = new CreateProductDto { Name = \"New Product\", Price = 19.99m };\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Act\n",
    "    var response = await _client.PostAsJsonAsync(\"/api/products\", newProduct);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Assert\n",
    "    Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.Created, response.StatusCode);\n",
    "    var createdProduct = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<ProductDto>();\n",
    "    Assert.NotNull(createdProduct);\n",
    "    Assert.Equal(\"New Product\", createdProduct.Name);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also verify that the product was actually added to the database by injecting the `DbContext` and querying it (though this couples the test to the database implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing Authorization\n",
    "\n",
    "If actions are protected with `[Authorize]`, you need to simulate an authenticated user. With integration tests, you can add an authentication handler that always succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// In ConfigureWebHost of your custom factory\n",

    "### 16.5 Best Practices for Testing in ASP.NET Core\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test behavior, not implementation** \u2013 Focus on what the code does, not how it does it. This makes tests less brittle.\n",
    "2. **Keep tests independent** \u2013 Each test should set up its own data and not rely on others.\n",
    "3. **Use meaningful names** \u2013 Method names should describe the scenario and expected outcome (e.g., `GetProduct_NonExistingId_ReturnsNotFound`).\n",
    "4. **Prefer integration tests for critical paths** \u2013 They give more confidence but are slower. Use unit tests for complex logic.\n",
    "5. **Use a clean database for integration tests** \u2013 Ensure each test runs with a known state. The in\u2011memory provider or a test container (e.g., Testcontainers) is great.\n",
    "6. **Mock external services** \u2013 For dependencies like email, payment gateways, use mocks or fake implementations to avoid calling real external systems.\n",
    "7. **Measure code coverage** \u2013 Tools like Coverlet can help identify untested code, but don\u2019t obsess over 100% coverage.\n",
    "8. **Run tests in CI** \u2013 Integrate your test suite into your continuous integration pipeline to catch failures early.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.6 Testing with a Real Database (Testcontainers)\n",
    "\n",
    "The in\u2011memory provider is fast but doesn\u2019t behave exactly like a real database (e.g., it ignores constraints, has different transaction behavior). For more realistic integration tests, you can use **Testcontainers** to spin up a real database in a Docker container for your tests.\n",

    "\n",
    "You\u2019ve now learned the essential testing techniques for ASP.NET Core applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unit tests** with xUnit to verify isolated logic.\n",
    "- **Mocking** with Moq to control dependencies and verify interactions.\n",
    "- **Integration tests** with `WebApplicationFactory` to exercise the full HTTP stack.\n",
    "- **Testing controllers** both in isolation and through integration.\n",
    "- **Best practices** to keep your tests maintainable and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a solid test suite, you can refactor with confidence, catch regressions early, and deliver higher\u2011quality software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a new feature to your application (e.g., a simple calculation service) and write unit tests for it using xUnit.\n",
    "2. Write a unit test for a controller action, mocking its dependencies with Moq.\n",
    "3. Create an integration test for one of your API endpoints using `WebApplicationFactory`. If possible, use an in\u2011memory database.\n",
    "4. (Optional) Set up Testcontainers to run a real database for your integration tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, **\"Clean Architecture & Domain\u2011Driven Design,\"** you\u2019ll learn how to structure your application using proven architectural patterns that separate concerns, enhance testability, and keep your codebase maintainable as it grows."
