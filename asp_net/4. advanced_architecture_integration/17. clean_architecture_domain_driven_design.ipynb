    "## Chapter 17: Clean Architecture & Domain\u2011Driven Design\n",
    "\n",
    "As applications grow, maintaining a clear separation of concerns becomes critical. Without a well\u2011defined architecture, codebases tend to become tangled, making changes difficult and bug\u2011prone. **Clean Architecture** (also known as Onion Architecture or Hexagonal Architecture) is a proven approach that organizes your code into concentric layers, with the core domain at the center. **Domain\u2011Driven Design (DDD)** provides principles and patterns for modeling complex business domains. In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn how to structure an ASP.NET Core application following Clean Architecture, how to separate your domain from infrastructure concerns, and how to apply DDD patterns like entities, value objects, aggregates, and domain services. By the end, you\u2019ll be able to build maintainable, testable, and business\u2011focused applications that can evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.1 The Onion / Clean Architecture Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean Architecture organizes software into layers, with dependencies pointing inward. The core contains the business logic and domain model, while outer layers contain infrastructure details like databases, user interfaces, and external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical Clean Architecture for an ASP.NET Core application consists of four main projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Domain** (Core) \u2013 Contains entities, value objects, aggregates, domain services, and domain interfaces (e.g., repository interfaces). Has no external dependencies.\n",
    "2. **Application** (Use Cases) \u2013 Contains application logic, DTOs, command/query handlers, and interfaces that the infrastructure layer implements. Depends only on Domain.\n",
    "3. **Infrastructure** \u2013 Implements persistence (e.g., Entity Framework Core), email sending, file storage, etc. Depends on Application (to implement its interfaces) and Domain.\n",
    "4. **Presentation** (Web) \u2013 ASP.NET Core MVC or API project. Depends on Application and Infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation ensures that business rules are not polluted by infrastructure concerns, and you can swap out implementations (e.g., change databases) without affecting the core logic.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Dependency rule:** Source code dependencies must point inward. The Domain layer has no knowledge of outer layers. Application knows Domain but not Infrastructure. Infrastructure knows both Application and Domain (to implement their interfaces). Presentation knows Application and Infrastructure (to compose the app).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In a solution, you might have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MyApp.Domain` \u2013 Class library (no framework dependencies).\n",
    "- `MyApp.Application` \u2013 Class library (references Domain).\n",
    "- `MyApp.Infrastructure` \u2013 Class library (references Application and Domain; may reference EF Core, etc.).\n",
    "- `MyApp.Web` \u2013 ASP.NET Core project (references Application and Infrastructure).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.2 Separating Concerns: Why the Web Project Shouldn\u2019t Directly Reference EF Core\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional ASP.NET Core applications, you often see `DbContext` directly used in controllers. This couples your presentation layer to the data access technology. If you decide to switch from SQL Server to PostgreSQL, or from EF Core to Dapper, you have to change every controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean Architecture solves this by placing data access interfaces in the **Domain** or **Application** layer, and their implementations in **Infrastructure**. Controllers depend only on **Application** services (or repositories interfaces). They never reference EF Core directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Repository Interface in Domain\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// In Domain project\n",
    "namespace MyApp.Domain.Repositories\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public interface IProductRepository\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Task<Product> GetByIdAsync(int id);\n",
    "        Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllAsync();\n",
    "        void Add(Product product);\n",
    "        void Update(Product product);\n",

    "#### Implementation in Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// In Infrastructure project\n",
    "using MyApp.Domain.Entities;\n",
    "using MyApp.Domain.Repositories;\n",

    "The Web project has no reference to EF Core or Infrastructure. It only knows Application (and Domain transitively). This makes it easy to test controllers with mocked services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.3 Introduction to MediatR and the CQRS Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "As applications become more complex, the **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** pattern helps separate read and write operations. Commands change state; queries retrieve data. This separation allows you to optimize each side independently (e.g., using different databases or caching strategies).\n",
    "\n",
    "**MediatR** is a popular library that implements the mediator pattern, helping you implement CQRS by decoupling request handling from controllers. You send a command or query to MediatR, and it dispatches it to the appropriate handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing MediatR\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package MediatR\n",
    "dotnet add package MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic CQRS with MediatR\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define a Query:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using MediatR;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class GetProductQuery : IRequest<ProductDto>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public int Id { get; set; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define a Handler:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class GetProductQueryHandler : IRequestHandler<GetProductQuery, ProductDto>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly IProductRepository _productRepository;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public GetProductQueryHandler(IProductRepository productRepository)\n",
    "    {\n",

    "        };\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define a Command:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class CreateProductCommand : IRequest<int>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string Name { get; set; }\n",

    "**Handler for Command:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class CreateProductCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<CreateProductCommand, int>\n",
    "{\n",

    "\n",
    "    public CreateProductCommandHandler(IProductRepository productRepository)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of MediatR + CQRS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Responsibility:** Each handler focuses on one use case.\n",
    "- **Decoupling:** Controllers don\u2019t need to know about services or repositories; they just send messages.\n",
    "- **Pipeline Behaviors:** You can add cross\u2011cutting concerns like logging, validation, or transaction handling by implementing `IPipelineBehavior`.\n",
    "- **Testability:** Handlers are easy to unit test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Validation Behavior with FluentValidation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a pipeline behavior that automatically validates commands before they reach the handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class ValidationBehavior<TRequest, TResponse> : IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>\n",
    "    where TRequest : IRequest<TResponse>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly IEnumerable<IValidator<TRequest>> _validators;\n",

    "    {\n",
    "        if (_validators.Any())\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            var context = new ValidationContext<TRequest>(request);\n",
    "            var validationResults = await Task.WhenAll(_validators.Select(v => v.ValidateAsync(context, cancellationToken)));\n",
    "            var failures = validationResults.SelectMany(r => r.Errors).Where(f => f != null).ToList();\n",
    "            if (failures.Count != 0)\n",
    "                throw new ValidationException(failures);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        return await next();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Register it in DI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "builder.Services.AddValidatorsFromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly);\n",
    "builder.Services.AddTransient(typeof(IPipelineBehavior<,>), typeof(ValidationBehavior<,>));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.4 Using FluentValidation for Complex Validation Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "While data annotations work for simple validation, they can become messy for complex rules that involve multiple properties or dependencies. **FluentValidation** is a popular library that provides a fluent interface for building strongly\u2011typed validation rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing FluentValidation\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package FluentValidation.AspNetCore\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Validator\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using FluentValidation;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class CreateProductCommandValidator : AbstractValidator<CreateProductCommand>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public CreateProductCommandValidator()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        RuleFor(x => x.Name)\n",
    "            .NotEmpty().WithMessage(\"Name is required.\")\n",
    "            .MaximumLength(100).WithMessage(\"Name must not exceed 100 characters.\");\n",
    "\n",
    "        RuleFor(x => x.Price)\n",
    "            .GreaterThan(0).WithMessage(\"Price must be greater than zero.\")\n",
    "            .LessThanOrEqualTo(10000).WithMessage(\"Price cannot exceed 10000.\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrating with ASP.NET Core\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Program.cs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "builder.Services.AddFluentValidationAutoValidation(); // Auto-validation for controllers\n",
    "builder.Services.AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<CreateProductCommandValidator>();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when a `CreateProductCommand` arrives at an API controller, FluentValidation will automatically validate it and add errors to `ModelState`. You can also manually validate using the validator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using FluentValidation with MediatR (as shown earlier)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine FluentValidation with MediatR\u2019s pipeline behavior to centralize validation logic, ensuring that commands are valid before reaching the handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.5 Domain\u2011Driven Design Basics\n",

    "Domain\u2011Driven Design (DDD) is a methodology for handling complex business domains. It emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts, and it provides tactical patterns for modeling the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key DDD Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entity:** An object with a unique identity that persists over time. Its attributes may change, but its identity remains the same. Example: `Product` (identified by `Id`).\n",
    "- **Value Object:** An immutable object that has no identity and is defined solely by its attributes. Example: `Address` (street, city, zip code). Two addresses with the same values are considered equal.\n",
    "- **Aggregate:** A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. One entity is the aggregate root, which is the only object external objects can reference directly. Example: `Order` (root) contains `OrderLine` items. You interact with the order through the root.\n",
    "- **Domain Service:** A stateless service that encapsulates business logic that doesn\u2019t naturally fit into an entity or value object. Example: `TaxCalculator` that computes tax based on order and customer location.\n",
    "- **Repository:** A mechanism for retrieving and storing aggregates. It provides a collection\u2011like interface for aggregate roots.\n",
    "- **Domain Event:** Something that happened in the domain that domain experts care about. Other parts of the system can react to it. Example: `OrderPlaced` event triggers email confirmation and inventory updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying DDD in Clean Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In Clean Architecture, the Domain layer contains entities, value objects, aggregates, domain services, and repository interfaces. The Application layer orchestrates use cases, often using domain services and repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Order Aggregate\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// Domain/Entities/Order.cs\n",
    "public class Order : IAggregateRoot\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public int Id { get; private set; }\n",
    "    public DateTime OrderDate { get; private set; }\n",
    "    public string CustomerId { get; private set; }\n",
    "    private readonly List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new();\n",
    "    public IReadOnlyCollection<OrderLine> OrderLines => _orderLines.AsReadOnly();\n",
    "\n",
    "    private Order() { } // For EF Core\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Order(string customerId)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        CustomerId = customerId;\n",
    "        OrderDate = DateTime.UtcNow;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void AddProduct(Product product, int quantity)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Business rule: cannot add duplicate product? Quantity must be positive?\n",
    "        var line = new OrderLine(product.Id, quantity, product.Price);\n",
    "        _orderLines.Add(line);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public decimal TotalPrice => _orderLines.Sum(ol => ol.TotalPrice);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Domain/Entities/OrderLine.cs (Value Object / Entity)\n",
    "public class OrderLine\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public int Id { get; private set; } // Might be an entity if it has its own identity, or a value object if it's part of the aggregate.\n",
    "    public int ProductId { get; private set; }\n",
    "    public int Quantity { get; private set; }\n",
    "    public decimal UnitPrice { get; private set; }\n",
    "    public decimal TotalPrice => Quantity * UnitPrice;\n",
    "\n",
    "    internal OrderLine(int productId, int quantity, decimal unitPrice)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        ProductId = productId;\n",
    "        Quantity = quantity;\n",
    "        UnitPrice = unitPrice;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    private OrderLine() { } // For EF Core\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the `Order` class encapsulates business rules (like how to add a product) and ensures the aggregate is always in a valid state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Repository Interface for Order\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public interface IOrderRepository\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Task<Order> GetByIdAsync(int id);\n",
    "    void Add(Order order);\n",
    "    void Update(Order order);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domain Service Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class PricingService\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public decimal CalculateTax(Order order, string customerCountry)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Complex tax calculation logic\n",
    "        return order.TotalPrice * 0.1m; // Simplified\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using the Aggregate in a Use Case (Application Layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class PlaceOrderCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<PlaceOrderCommand, int>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;\n",
    "    private readonly IProductRepository _productRepository;\n",
    "    private readonly PricingService _pricingService;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public PlaceOrderCommandHandler(IOrderRepository orderRepository, IProductRepository productRepository, PricingService pricingService)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _orderRepository = orderRepository;\n",
    "        _productRepository = productRepository;\n",
    "        _pricingService = pricingService;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public async Task<int> Handle(PlaceOrderCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        var order = new Order(request.CustomerId);\n",
    "        foreach (var item in request.Items)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            var product = await _productRepository.GetByIdAsync(item.ProductId);\n",
    "            if (product == null) throw new Exception(\"Product not found\");\n",
    "            order.AddProduct(product, item.Quantity);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        var tax = _pricingService.CalculateTax(order, request.CustomerCountry);\n",
    "        // Maybe add tax as a separate line?\n",
    "\n",
    "        _orderRepository.Add(order);\n",
    "        await _orderRepository.SaveChangesAsync(); // Assume unit of work\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Raise domain event (e.g., orderPlacedEvent)\n",
    "        return order.Id;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.6 MediatR and CQRS in Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "We already introduced MediatR. In a Clean Architecture + DDD context, you typically place commands, queries, and their handlers in the **Application** layer. The handlers use domain objects (entities, value objects) and domain services, and they coordinate infrastructure via interfaces (repositories, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Separating Commands and Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "With CQRS, you might have separate models for reading and writing. For example, a query might return a flattened DTO without involving the full domain model, possibly using Dapper for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a query handler using Dapper directly (infrastructure):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class GetProductDetailsQueryHandler : IRequestHandler<GetProductDetailsQuery, ProductDetailsDto>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly DapperConnectionFactory _connectionFactory;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public GetProductDetailsQueryHandler(DapperConnectionFactory connectionFactory)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _connectionFactory = connectionFactory;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public async Task<ProductDetailsDto> Handle(GetProductDetailsQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        using var connection = _connectionFactory.Create();\n",
    "        var sql = \"SELECT Id, Name, Price, Description FROM Products WHERE Id = @Id\";\n",
    "        var product = await connection.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync<ProductDetailsDto>(sql, new { request.Id });\n",
    "        return product;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query bypasses the domain model entirely, which is fine for read operations where you don\u2019t need business rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of CQRS with MediatR\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability:** You can optimize reads and writes separately.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** Each use case is a small, focused handler.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** You can add new features without affecting existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.7 Implementing Clean Architecture in ASP.NET Core \u2013 Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\u2019s outline the steps to set up a solution following Clean Architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a blank solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   dotnet new sln -n MyApp\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the projects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   dotnet new classlib -n MyApp.Domain\n",
    "   dotnet new classlib -n MyApp.Application\n",
    "   dotnet new classlib -n MyApp.Infrastructure\n",
    "   dotnet new webapi -n MyApp.Web\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add project references:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Application references Domain.\n",
    "   - Infrastructure references Application and Domain.\n",
    "   - Web references Application and Infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   dotnet add MyApp.Application reference MyApp.Domain\n",
    "   dotnet add MyApp.Infrastructure reference MyApp.Application\n",
    "   dotnet add MyApp.Infrastructure reference MyApp.Domain\n",
    "   dotnet add MyApp.Web reference MyApp.Application\n",
    "   dotnet add MyApp.Web reference MyApp.Infrastructure\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add necessary packages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Infrastructure: `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`, etc.\n",
    "   - Application: `MediatR`, `FluentValidation`\n",
    "   - Web: `MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`, `FluentValidation.AspNetCore`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Define Domain entities and interfaces.**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Implement repositories in Infrastructure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Define commands/queries and handlers in Application.**\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Configure DI in Web\u2019s `Program.cs`**, registering services from all layers (e.g., using `AddMediatR`, `AddScoped<IOrderRepository, OrderRepository>`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependency Injection in Clean Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you create extension methods in each layer to register their services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Infrastructure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public static class DependencyInjection\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static IServiceCollection AddInfrastructure(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>\n",
    "            options.UseSqlServer(configuration.GetConnectionString(\"DefaultConnection\")));\n",
    "        services.AddScoped<IProductRepository, ProductRepository>();\n",
    "        services.AddScoped<IOrderRepository, OrderRepository>();\n",
    "        return services;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Application:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public static class DependencyInjection\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static IServiceCollection AddApplication(this IServiceCollection services)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        services.AddMediatR(cfg => cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(typeof(DependencyInjection).Assembly));\n",
    "        services.AddValidatorsFromAssembly(typeof(DependencyInjection).Assembly);\n",
    "        services.AddScoped<PricingService>(); // domain service\n",
    "        return services;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Web\u2019s `Program.cs`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "builder.Services.AddApplication();\n",
    "builder.Services.AddInfrastructure(builder.Configuration);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This keeps the composition root clean and decoupled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.8 Advantages of Clean Architecture + DDD\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testability:** Each layer can be tested in isolation. You can unit test domain logic without any infrastructure.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** Business rules are centralized in the Domain layer, not scattered across controllers or services.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Swapping out infrastructure (e.g., changing ORM) is a matter of re\u2011implementing a few interfaces.\n",
    "- **Team scalability:** Different teams can work on different layers with minimal conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned how to structure an ASP.NET Core application using Clean Architecture and Domain\u2011Driven Design principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clean Architecture** organizes code into concentric layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation) with dependencies pointing inward.\n",
    "- **Separating concerns** prevents the web project from being tightly coupled to infrastructure concerns like EF Core.\n",
    "- **MediatR** helps implement the **CQRS pattern**, decoupling request handling and enabling pipeline behaviors.\n",
    "- **FluentValidation** provides a powerful, fluent way to validate commands and queries.\n",
    "- **DDD** patterns (entities, value objects, aggregates, domain services) help model complex business domains effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these patterns, you can build applications that are robust, maintainable, and ready to evolve as business requirements change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Refactor your existing project (or a new one) to follow Clean Architecture. Create separate projects for Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Web.\n",
    "2. Move your domain models (e.g., `Product`, `Category`) to the Domain project.\n",
    "3. Define repository interfaces in Domain and implement them in Infrastructure using EF Core.\n",
    "4. Create a MediatR command and handler for creating a product, and a query for retrieving a product.\n",
    "5. Add FluentValidation to validate the create command.\n",
    "6. Ensure that your controllers use MediatR and do not reference Infrastructure directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, **\"Working with Real\u2011Time Features (SignalR),\"** you\u2019ll learn how to add real\u2011time functionality to your applications using SignalR. You\u2019ll build live dashboards, chat systems, and notification services that push data from server to clients instantly."
