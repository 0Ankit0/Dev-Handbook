    "## Chapter 11: Logging and Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "In any production application, things will go wrong. Users will encounter errors, external services will fail, and unexpected conditions will arise. How you handle these situations determines the reliability and maintainability of your system. **Logging** provides insight into what your application is doing, while **error handling** ensures that failures are managed gracefully and communicated clearly to clients. ASP.NET Core has built\u2011in, extensible logging and robust error handling middleware. In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn how to use the `ILogger<T>` interface, configure logging providers, implement global exception handling, and create friendly error pages. By the end, you\u2019ll be able to build applications that are observable and resilient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.1 Built\u2011in Logging Framework (`ILogger<T>`)\n",
    "\n",
    "ASP.NET Core includes a logging API that works with a variety of built\u2011in and third\u2011party logging providers. The primary interface is `ILogger<T>`, where `T` is typically the class that is doing the logging. This ties log messages to the source class, making it easier to filter and analyze logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Logger\n",
    "\n",
    "To use logging in a controller or service, inject `ILogger<T>` via the constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class ProductsController : ControllerBase\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly IProductService _productService;\n",
    "    private readonly ILogger<ProductsController> _logger;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public ProductsController(IProductService productService, ILogger<ProductsController> logger)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _productService = productService;\n",
    "        _logger = logger;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\n",
    "    public async Task<ActionResult<ProductDto>> GetProduct(int id)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _logger.LogInformation(\"Fetching product with ID {ProductId}\", id);\n",
    "\n",
    "        try\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            var product = await _productService.GetProductByIdAsync(id);\n",
    "            if (product == null)\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                _logger.LogWarning(\"Product with ID {ProductId} not found\", id);\n",
    "                return NotFound();\n",
    "            }\n",
    "\n",
    "            return Ok(product);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        catch (Exception ex)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            _logger.LogError(ex, \"Error fetching product with ID {ProductId}\", id);\n",
    "            throw; // Let global handler deal with it\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Log Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Log messages have a level indicating their severity. The framework defines the following levels (from lowest to highest):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Trace` \u2013 Very detailed, potentially high\u2011volume logs, typically used only in development.\n",
    "- `Debug` \u2013 Debugging information, less detailed than Trace.\n",
    "- `Information` \u2013 General information about application flow.\n",
    "- `Warning` \u2013 An unexpected but recoverable situation.\n",
    "- `Error` \u2013 A failure that prevents a specific operation from completing.\n",
    "- `Critical` \u2013 A catastrophic failure that may cause the application to abort.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can filter logs based on these levels in configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Log Message Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Always use **structured logging** (also called semantic logging). Instead of concatenating strings, use message templates with placeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "_logger.LogInformation(\"Processing user {UserName} with ID {UserId}\", user.Name, user.Id);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The placeholders (`{UserName}`, `{UserId}`) are not just for formatting; they become structured properties in the log output. This enables powerful querying and analysis in log aggregators like Seq, Elasticsearch, or Application Insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Available Logging Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ILogger` interface provides extension methods for each level:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LogTrace()`\n",
    "- `LogDebug()`\n",
    "- `LogInformation()`\n",
    "- `LogWarning()`\n",
    "- `LogError()`\n",
    "- `LogCritical()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each accepts a message template and parameters, and optionally an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.2 Logging to Different Providers (Console, Debug, File, Seq)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a new ASP.NET Core project includes the Console and Debug providers. You can add more providers via NuGet packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Default Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Program.cs`, you\u2019ll see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "builder.Logging.ClearProviders();\n",
    "builder.Logging.AddConsole();\n",
    "builder.Logging.AddDebug();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`ClearProviders()` removes the default set (which may include Console, Debug, EventSource, etc.), then you explicitly add the ones you want. Alternatively, you can leave the defaults and add more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding a File Provider\n",
    "\n",
    "To log to a file, you can use a third\u2011party provider like **Serilog** (more on that later) or a simple file logger. For simplicity, we'll show how to add the built\u2011in file logging via the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.File` package (if available) but note that this is not part of the default templates; often people use Serilog for file logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Serilog for file logging** (industry standard):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install packages:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore\n",
    "   dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.File\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In `Program.cs`, configure Serilog before building the host:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Serilog;\n",
    "\n",
    "Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()\n",
    "    .WriteTo.Console()\n",
    "    .WriteTo.File(\"logs/myapp.txt\", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)\n",
    "    .CreateLogger();\n",
    "\n",
    "var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n",
    "builder.Host.UseSerilog(); // Replace default logging with Serilog\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now logs will go to both console and a daily rolling file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Seq\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seq** is a structured log server. To send logs to Seq:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Seq\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then add the Seq sink:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()\n",
    "    .WriteTo.Console()\n",
    "    .WriteTo.Seq(\"http://localhost:5341\")\n",
    "    .CreateLogger();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration via `appsettings.json`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control log levels and providers via configuration. For the built\u2011in logging, add a `Logging` section:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"Logging\": {\n",
    "    \"LogLevel\": {\n",
    "      \"Default\": \"Information\",\n",
    "      \"Microsoft\": \"Warning\",\n",
    "      \"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime\": \"Information\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"Console\": {\n",
    "      \"LogLevel\": {\n",
    "        \"Default\": \"Debug\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets default levels for namespaces and overrides for the console provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.3 Global Exception Handling Middleware\n",
    "\n",
    "Unhandled exceptions in your application will crash the request and return a generic 500 error page (or no response in APIs). You need a centralized way to handle exceptions, log them, and return meaningful error responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `UseExceptionHandler` for MVC/Page Apps\n",
    "\n",
    "For applications that return HTML, you can use the Exception Handler Middleware to redirect to a custom error page.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())\n",
    "{\n",
    "    app.UseExceptionHandler(\"/Home/Error\");\n",
    "    app.UseHsts();\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This registers a middleware that catches exceptions, logs them, and re\u2011executes the pipeline for the `/Home/Error` path. You need an `Error` action in your `HomeController`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[AllowAnonymous]\n",
    "[ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None)]\n",
    "public IActionResult Error()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    return View(new ErrorViewModel { RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier });\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Error.cshtml` view shows a friendly message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom Exception Handling Middleware\n",
    "\n",
    "For APIs, you typically want to return structured error responses. You can write custom middleware that catches exceptions and formats them as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class ErrorHandlingMiddleware\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;\n",
    "    private readonly ILogger<ErrorHandlingMiddleware> _logger;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public ErrorHandlingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<ErrorHandlingMiddleware> logger)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _next = next;\n",
    "        _logger = logger;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        try\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            await _next(context);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        catch (Exception ex)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            _logger.LogError(ex, \"An unhandled exception occurred.\");\n",
    "            await HandleExceptionAsync(context, ex);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    private static Task HandleExceptionAsync(HttpContext context, Exception exception)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        context.Response.ContentType = \"application/json\";\n",
    "        context.Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError;\n",
    "\n",
    "        var response = new\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            error = new\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                message = \"An error occurred while processing your request.\",\n",
    "                detail = exception.Message // Be careful: don't expose sensitive details in production\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        };\n",
    "\n",
    "        return context.Response.WriteAsync(JsonSerializer.Serialize(response));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Register it in `Program.cs` before other middleware:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.UseMiddleware<ErrorHandlingMiddleware>();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `UseExceptionHandler` with a Custom Handler for APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `UseExceptionHandler` with a lambda to return JSON:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.UseExceptionHandler(appError =>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    appError.Run(async context =>\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        context.Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError;\n",
    "        context.Response.ContentType = \"application/json\";\n",
    "\n",
    "        var contextFeature = context.Features.Get<IExceptionHandlerFeature>();\n",
    "        if (contextFeature != null)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            var logger = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();\n",
    "            logger.LogError(contextFeature.Error, \"Unhandled exception.\");\n",
    "\n",
    "            await context.Response.WriteAsync(JsonSerializer.Serialize(new\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                StatusCode = context.Response.StatusCode,\n",
    "                Message = \"Internal Server Error.\"\n",
    "            }));\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This keeps the built\u2011in exception handling but customizes the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.4 Using `app.UseExceptionHandler` and Status Code Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Status Code Pages Middleware\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides exceptions, you may want to handle non\u2011success status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found) in a friendly way. The Status Code Pages middleware can display custom pages for specific status codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute(\"/Home/Error/{0}\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or for APIs, you can return JSON:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.UseStatusCodePages(async context =>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    context.HttpContext.Response.ContentType = \"application/json\";\n",
    "    await context.HttpContext.Response.WriteAsync(JsonSerializer.Serialize(new\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        StatusCode = context.HttpContext.Response.StatusCode,\n",
    "        Message = \"The requested resource was not found.\"\n",
    "    }));\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combining Exception and Status Code Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "You can chain middleware:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "if (env.IsDevelopment())\n",
    "{\n",
    "    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    app.UseExceptionHandler(\"/error\");\n",
    "    app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute(\"/error/{0}\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in an `ErrorController`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[Route(\"error\")]\n",
    "public class ErrorController : Controller\n",
    "{\n",
    "    [Route(\"{statusCode?}\")]\n",
    "    public IActionResult Index(int? statusCode)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if (statusCode.HasValue)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            ViewBag.ErrorMessage = $\"Status code: {statusCode}\";\n",
    "            // Log or handle specific status codes\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        return View();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.5 Structured Logging with Serilog (Advanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured logging goes beyond text; it captures properties that can be queried. Serilog is the most popular structured logging library for .NET.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Setup with Serilog\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown earlier, you configure Serilog at the program entry point.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()\n",
    "    .MinimumLevel.Debug()\n",
    "    .WriteTo.Console()\n",
    "    .WriteTo.File(\"logs/myapp.txt\", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)\n",
    "    .WriteTo.Seq(\"http://localhost:5341\")\n",
    "    .Enrich.WithProperty(\"Application\", \"MyApp\")\n",
    "    .Enrich.WithMachineName()\n",
    "    .Enrich.WithThreadId()\n",
    "    .CreateLogger();\n",
    "\n",
    "try\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Log.Information(\"Starting web application\");\n",
    "    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n",
    "    builder.Host.UseSerilog(); // Important: replaces ILoggerFactory\n",
    "    // ... rest of builder\n",
    "    var app = builder.Build();\n",
    "    app.Run();\n",
    "}\n",
    "catch (Exception ex)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Log.Fatal(ex, \"Application start-up failed\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "finally\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Log.CloseAndFlush();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all logs (including those from ASP.NET Core infrastructure) go through Serilog, capturing structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Log Enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrichers add additional properties to every log event, such as machine name, thread ID, or custom properties. This is invaluable for filtering in a central log system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Destructuring\n",
    "\n",
    "Serilog can destructure complex objects. For example, if you log a DTO, Serilog can serialize its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "_logger.LogInformation(\"Created product {@Product}\", productDto);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@` tells Serilog to serialize the object, not just call `ToString()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.6 Health Checks Middleware (`/health` endpoints)\n",
    "\n",
    "Production applications need a way to report their health to monitoring systems (like Kubernetes, Azure Load Balancer, etc.). ASP.NET Core provides health checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Basic Health Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the package if needed (it's included in the web template):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Program.cs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "builder.Services.AddHealthChecks();\n",
    "\n",
    "// ...\n",
    "\n",
    "app.MapHealthChecks(\"/health\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now a GET request to `/health` returns a simple status (e.g., \"Healthy\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Customizing Health Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add checks for specific dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()\n",
    "    .AddDbContextCheck<AppDbContext>()  // Checks database connectivity\n",
    "    .AddUrlGroup(new Uri(\"https://api.example.com\"), \"External API\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create custom health checks by implementing `IHealthCheck`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Health Check UI\n",
    "\n",
    "For a richer view, you can add the `AspNetCore.HealthChecks.UI` client, but that's beyond our scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you\u2019ve learned the essentials of logging and error handling in ASP.NET Core:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging** with `ILogger<T>` and structured message templates.\n",
    "- Configuring **logging providers** (Console, File, Seq) and understanding log levels.\n",
    "- Implementing **global exception handling** via middleware and built\u2011in exception handler.\n",
    "- Using **status code pages** for friendly error responses.\n",
    "- Advanced logging with **Serilog** for structured, queryable logs.\n",
    "- Adding **health checks** for monitoring application availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these tools, your applications become observable and resilient, capable of surviving failures and providing insights into their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your existing project, add logging to all controller actions (Information for normal flow, Warning for missing resources, Error for exceptions).\n",
    "2. Configure Serilog to log to both console and a rolling file. Set minimum log level to Debug in development and Warning in production (use `appsettings.json` for configuration).\n",
    "3. Create a custom exception handling middleware that catches exceptions and returns a JSON error response for API controllers (check if the request expects JSON via `Accept` header).\n",
    "4. Add a health check endpoint that verifies database connectivity (using `AddDbContextCheck`).\n",
    "5. Test your error handling by causing an exception (e.g., divide by zero) and verify that it's logged and a proper response is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, **\"Configuration and Options Pattern,\"** you\u2019ll learn how to manage application settings across environments, bind configuration to strongly\u2011typed classes, and use the options pattern for clean, testable configuration access."
