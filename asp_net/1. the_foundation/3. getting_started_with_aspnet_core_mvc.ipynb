    "## Chapter 3: Getting Started with ASP.NET Core MVC\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand C# fundamentals and how HTTP works, it's time to build your first web application using ASP.NET Core MVC. MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a proven architectural pattern that separates concerns, making your code organized, testable, and maintainable. In this chapter, you\u2019ll create a new MVC project, explore its structure, learn how routing maps URLs to actions, dive deep into controllers, and build views using the Razor syntax. By the end, you\u2019ll have a working web application that displays dynamic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 The MVC Architectural Pattern (Model-View-Controller)\n",
    "\n",
    "MVC divides your application into three interconnected components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic. It knows nothing about the user interface. In a web app, models are typically plain C# classes that hold data (e.g., a `Product` class) and may include validation rules or business methods.\n",
    "- **View**: Responsible for presenting data to the user. In ASP.NET Core, views are `.cshtml` files that mix HTML with C# code using Razor syntax. Views are purely presentational; they should not contain complex logic.\n",
    "- **Controller**: Handles user input and interactions. It receives HTTP requests, works with the model (e.g., fetches data from a database), selects a view to render, and returns the response. Controllers are the traffic cops of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How they interact:**\n",
    "1. The browser sends an HTTP request (e.g., `GET /products`).\n",
    "2. The routing system maps the URL to a specific controller action (e.g., `ProductsController.Index()`).\n",
    "3. The controller action processes the request: it might fetch data from the model (e.g., query a database via Entity Framework Core), perform business logic, and prepare data for the view.\n",
    "4. The controller returns a view, passing the model data to it.\n",
    "5. The view generates HTML using the model data and sends it back to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation allows multiple developers to work on different parts, makes unit testing easier (you can test controllers without views), and promotes reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Creating Your First MVC Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\u2019s create a new ASP.NET Core MVC project. You can use either the .NET CLI or Visual Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using the .NET CLI\n",
    "Open a terminal and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet new mvc -n MyFirstMvcApp\n",
    "cd MyFirstMvcApp\n",
    "dotnet run\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Visual Studio 2022\n",
    "1. File \u2192 New \u2192 Project.\n",
    "2. Select \"ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)\".\n",
    "3. Name it `MyFirstMvcApp` and choose a location.\n",
    "4. Select .NET 8.0 (or latest LTS) and keep default options.\n",
    "5. Click Create.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creation, you'll see a solution with several folders and files:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MyFirstMvcApp/\n",
    "\u251c\u2500\u2500 Controllers/         # Controllers go here\n",
    "\u251c\u2500\u2500 Views/               # Views, organized by controller\n",
    "\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Home/            # Views for HomeController\n",
    "\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Shared/          # Shared views (layout, partials)\n",
    "\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 _ViewStart.cshtml\n",
    "\u251c\u2500\u2500 Models/              # Model classes\n",
    "\u251c\u2500\u2500 wwwroot/             # Static files (CSS, JS, images)\n",
    "\u251c\u2500\u2500 appsettings.json     # Configuration\n",
    "\u251c\u2500\u2500 Program.cs           # Application startup\n",
    "\u2514\u2500\u2500 MyFirstMvcApp.csproj # Project file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run the application:**\n",
    "- If using CLI, navigate to the project folder and run `dotnet run`. Open `https://localhost:5001` (or the URL shown) in your browser.\n",
    "- If using Visual Studio, press F5.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see a default home page with a navigation bar. This template includes sample pages for Home, Privacy, etc., giving you a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Routing: Mapping URLs to Controllers and Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing is the mechanism that matches incoming URLs to controller actions. ASP.NET Core supports two types of routing: conventional routing and attribute routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conventional Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventional routing uses a route template defined in `Program.cs`. The default template looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "app.MapControllerRoute(\n",
    "    name: \"default\",\n",
    "    pattern: \"{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the pattern:\n",
    "- `{controller=Home}`: The first segment is the controller name. If not provided, it defaults to `Home`.\n",
    "- `{action=Index}`: The second segment is the action name. Defaults to `Index`.\n",
    "- `{id?}`: The third segment is an optional `id` parameter. The `?` makes it optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a request to `/products/details/5` would map to `ProductsController` with action `Details` and `id = 5`. A request to `/` maps to `HomeController.Index()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventional routing is centralized and consistent. It works well for traditional web applications with many pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attribute Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute routing gives you more control by placing routes directly on controllers and actions using attributes. This is the preferred approach for Web APIs and is also commonly used in MVC applications for specific routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[Route(\"products\")]\n",
    "public class ProductsController : Controller\n",
    "{\n",
    "    [Route(\"\")]              // matches /products\n",
    "    [Route(\"index\")]         // matches /products/index\n",
    "    public IActionResult Index() { ... }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Route(\"details/{id}\")]  // matches /products/details/5\n",
    "    public IActionResult Details(int id) { ... }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Route(\"create\")]\n",
    "    public IActionResult Create() { ... }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine both routing styles in the same application. To enable attribute routing, you typically call `app.MapControllers()` (for API controllers) or just rely on the default conventional route. Attribute routing takes precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Route Parameters and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add constraints to route parameters to enforce types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[Route(\"products/details/{id:int}\")]  // id must be an integer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Common constraints: `int`, `bool`, `datetime`, `guid`, `min(5)`, `max(10)`, `regex(...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example in a controller action:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[HttpGet(\"products/details/{id:int}\")]\n",
    "public IActionResult Details(int id)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // id is guaranteed to be an integer\n",
    "    var product = _productService.GetById(id);\n",
    "    if (product == null)\n",
    "        return NotFound();\n",
    "    return View(product);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why routing matters:** It decouples your URL structure from your code organization. You can change URLs without renaming controllers, and you can create user-friendly, SEO-optimized URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Controllers in Depth: Handling Requests and Returning Results\n",
    "\n",
    "A controller is a class that derives from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Controller`. It contains public methods called **actions**. Each action corresponds to an endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Simple Controller\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a new controller named `ProductsController` inside the `Controllers` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace MyFirstMvcApp.Controllers\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public class ProductsController : Controller\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        public IActionResult Index()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            return View();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public IActionResult Details(int id)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            ViewBag.ProductId = id;\n",
    "            return View();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create corresponding views:\n",
    "- `Views/Products/Index.cshtml`\n",
    "- `Views/Products/Details.cshtml`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can generate these by right-clicking the action method in Visual Studio and selecting \"Add View\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions return implementations of `IActionResult`. Common results include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `View()` \u2013 Renders a view (default is same name as action). Can pass a model.\n",
    "- `PartialView()` \u2013 Renders a partial view.\n",
    "- `Json()` \u2013 Returns JSON data.\n",
    "- `Content()` \u2013 Returns plain text.\n",
    "- `Redirect()` / `RedirectToAction()` \u2013 Redirects to another URL or action.\n",
    "- `NotFound()` \u2013 Returns HTTP 404.\n",
    "- `BadRequest()` \u2013 Returns HTTP 400.\n",
    "- `Ok()` \u2013 Returns HTTP 200 (useful in API controllers).\n",
    "- `StatusCode()` \u2013 Returns any HTTP status code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with various results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class TestController : Controller\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public IActionResult Text() => Content(\"Hello, world!\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    public IActionResult JsonData() => Json(new { Name = \"Sample\", Price = 19.99 });\n",
    "\n",
    "    public IActionResult RedirectExample() => Redirect(\"https://example.com\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    public IActionResult GoToIndex() => RedirectToAction(\"Index\", \"Home\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    public IActionResult NotFoundPage() => NotFound();\n",
    "\n",
    "    public IActionResult Error() => StatusCode(500);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters in Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions can receive parameters from the request via:\n",
    "- Route data (e.g., `{id}` in route template)\n",
    "- Query string (`?page=2`)\n",
    "- Form data (POST)\n",
    "- Request body (JSON for APIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "ASP.NET Core uses **model binding** to automatically map incoming data to action parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// URL: /products/search?category=electronics&page=2\n",
    "public IActionResult Search(string category, int page = 1)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // category = \"electronics\", page = 2\n",
    "    return Content($\"Searching {category}, page {page}\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex types, model binding creates an instance and populates its properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class SearchCriteria\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string Category { get; set; }\n",
    "    public int Page { get; set; }\n",
    "    public int PageSize { get; set; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public IActionResult Search(SearchCriteria criteria)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // criteria.Category, criteria.Page, etc. are populated\n",
    "    return View(criteria);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Controller Base Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Controller` base class provides many useful properties and methods:\n",
    "- `Request` \u2013 access to the HTTP request.\n",
    "- `Response` \u2013 manipulate the HTTP response.\n",
    "- `HttpContext` \u2013 the full context.\n",
    "- `User` \u2013 information about the current user.\n",
    "- `ModelState` \u2013 validation state.\n",
    "- `TempData` \u2013 dictionary for passing data between requests (uses cookies or session).\n",
    "- `ViewData` / `ViewBag` \u2013 pass data from controller to view.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example using ViewBag:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public IActionResult Welcome(string name)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    ViewBag.UserName = name;\n",
    "    ViewBag.CurrentTime = DateTime.Now;\n",
    "    return View();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the view (`Welcome.cshtml`), you can access:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h1>Welcome, @ViewBag.UserName!</h1>\n",
    "<p>The current time is @ViewBag.CurrentTime</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`ViewBag` is a dynamic wrapper around `ViewData`. It's convenient but lacks compile-time checking. For strongly typed data, use a **view model** (discussed later).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Views and the Razor Syntax (`@`, `@if`, `@foreach`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Views in ASP.NET Core are `.cshtml` files that combine HTML with C# code using Razor syntax. Razor is designed to be concise and expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Razor Syntax Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "- `@` transitions from HTML to C#. For example, `@DateTime.Now` outputs the current date and time.\n",
    "- Code blocks are enclosed in `@{ ... }`. For example, you can declare variables or write multi-line logic.\n",
    "- Control structures (`if`, `for`, `foreach`, `while`, `switch`) use a simplified syntax without braces (though you can add them for clarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "@{\n",
    "    var message = \"Hello, Razor!\";\n",
    "    var count = 5;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>@message</h1>\n",
    "<p>The count is @count.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "@if (count > 3)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    <p>Count is greater than 3.</p>\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    <p>Count is not greater than 3.</p>\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "@for (int i = 1; i <= count; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    <li>Item @i</li>\n",
    "}\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using a Model in a View\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you pass a strongly typed model from the controller to the view. This is done via the `View()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public IActionResult Details(int id)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    var product = new Product { Id = id, Name = \"Laptop\", Price = 999.99m };\n",
    "    return View(product); // passes product as the model\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the view, you declare the model type at the top using `@model` directive:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "@model Product\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>@Model.Name</h2>\n",
    "<p>Price: @Model.Price.ToString(\"C\")</p>\n",
    "<p>ID: @Model.Id</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`@model` (lowercase) specifies the type. `Model` (uppercase) is the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layout Pages and `_ViewStart.cshtml`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most web applications share common elements across pages: header, footer, navigation menu. Layout pages provide this shared structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default layout is `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`. It contains the overall HTML structure and calls `@RenderBody()` where the page-specific content is inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example `_Layout.cshtml` snippet:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <title>@ViewBag.Title - My App</title>\n",
    "    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"~/css/site.css\" />\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "    <header>...</header>\n",
    "    <main>\n",
    "        @RenderBody()\n",
    "    </main>\n",
    "    <footer>...</footer>\n",
    "    @await RenderSectionAsync(\"Scripts\", required: false)\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`_ViewStart.cshtml` runs before every view. It typically sets the layout:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "@{\n",
    "    Layout = \"_Layout\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can override the layout for a specific view by setting `Layout` inside the view.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partial Views\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial views are reusable pieces of Razor markup. They are stored in the `Shared` folder or in a controller-specific folder, usually with a leading underscore (e.g., `_ProductCard.cshtml`). Render a partial view using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<partial name=\"_ProductCard\" model=\"someProduct\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "@await Html.PartialAsync(\"_ProductCard\", product)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### View Components\n",
    "\n",
    "View components are more powerful than partials. They have their own logic (similar to a mini-controller) and can be used for dynamic, self-contained widgets like a shopping cart summary or a login panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover view components in Chapter 4 (Building Interactive Web Pages with Razor), but here's a quick example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class CartSummaryViewComponent : ViewComponent\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public IViewComponentResult Invoke()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        var itemCount = GetCartItemCount(); // some logic\n",
    "        return View(itemCount);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Invoke in a view:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "@await Component.InvokeAsync(\"CartSummary\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTML Helpers and Tag Helpers\n",
    "\n",
    "ASP.NET Core provides two ways to generate HTML in views: HTML Helpers (C# methods) and Tag Helpers (HTML-friendly attributes). Tag Helpers are the modern, preferred approach because they look like standard HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a Tag Helper for forms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<form asp-action=\"Create\" asp-controller=\"Products\" method=\"post\">\n",
    "    <label asp-for=\"Name\"></label>\n",
    "    <input asp-for=\"Name\" class=\"form-control\" />\n",
    "    <span asp-validation-for=\"Name\"></span>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <button type=\"submit\">Save</button>\n",
    "</form>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tag Helpers like `asp-action`, `asp-for`, etc., are processed on the server and emit appropriate HTML. They make your views cleaner and more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6 Putting It All Together: A Complete Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a simple product listing and details page to solidify the concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Models` folder, create `Product.cs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "namespace MyFirstMvcApp.Models\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public class Product\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        public int Id { get; set; }\n",

    "        public decimal Price { get; set; }\n",
    "        public string Description { get; set; }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Create a Controller\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Controllers`, create `ProductsController.cs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\n",
    "using MyFirstMvcApp.Models;\n",
    "using System.Collections.Generic;\n",
    "using System.Linq;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace MyFirstMvcApp.Controllers\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public class ProductsController : Controller\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Simulate a data store\n",
    "        private static List<Product> _products = new List<Product>\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            new Product { Id = 1, Name = \"Laptop\", Price = 999.99m, Description = \"High-performance laptop\" },\n",
    "            new Product { Id = 2, Name = \"Mouse\", Price = 19.99m, Description = \"Wireless mouse\" },\n",
    "            new Product { Id = 3, Name = \"Keyboard\", Price = 49.99m, Description = \"Mechanical keyboard\" }\n",

    "- How to create a new MVC project and understand its structure.\n",
    "- Routing\u2014both conventional and attribute\u2014and how URLs map to actions.\n",
    "- Controllers as the core of request handling, with various action results.\n",
    "- Views and Razor syntax for dynamic HTML generation, including layouts, partials, and Tag Helpers.\n",
