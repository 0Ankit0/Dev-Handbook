    "## Chapter 1: C# Fundamentals for Web Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the foundation of your ASP.NET journey! Before you can build robust web applications, you need a solid grasp of C#\u2014the primary language used in ASP.NET. This chapter is a carefully curated crash course. It\u2019s not meant to replace a full C# book, but to equip you with the essential knowledge and industry-standard practices you\u2019ll use daily as an ASP.NET developer. We\u2019ll cover syntax, object-oriented programming, interfaces, asynchronous programming, and modern null safety\u2014all with practical code snippets and thorough explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 C# Syntax, Data Types, and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "C# is a statically-typed, object-oriented language. Its syntax is clean and similar to other C-style languages (like Java or C++). Let\u2019s start with the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statements and Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "A C# program is made up of statements. Each statement ends with a semicolon (`;`). Multiple statements can be grouped into a block using curly braces `{ }`. Blocks define the scope of variables and are used in control structures (if, for, while) and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// This is a single statement\n",
    "Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "\n",
    "// A block containing two statements\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int x = 10;\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(x);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a named storage location in memory. In C#, you must declare the type of a variable before using it (or let the compiler infer it with `var`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value Types** hold their value directly in memory. Common value types include:\n",
    "- `int` \u2013 32-bit integer\n",
    "- `long` \u2013 64-bit integer\n",
    "- `float` \u2013 32-bit floating point (suffix `f`)\n",
    "- `double` \u2013 64-bit floating point (default for decimals)\n",
    "- `decimal` \u2013 128-bit high precision (suffix `m`), used for financial calculations\n",
    "- `bool` \u2013 true/false\n",
    "- `char` \u2013 a single Unicode character\n",
    "- `struct` \u2013 user-defined value type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference Types** store a reference to the actual data. The variable holds the memory address of the object. Common reference types include:\n",
    "- `string` \u2013 a sequence of characters (immutable)\n",
    "- `class` \u2013 user-defined type\n",
    "- `interface`\n",
    "- `array`\n",
    "- `delegate`\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// Value type examples\n",
    "int age = 30;\n",
    "double price = 19.99;\n",
    "bool isActive = true;\n",
    "char grade = 'A';\n",
    "\n",
    "// Reference type examples\n",
    "string name = \"Alice\";\n",
    "int[] numbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type Inference with `var`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `var` keyword tells the compiler to infer the type from the expression on the right-hand side. It\u2019s not a dynamic type; the variable is still statically typed. Use `var` when the type is obvious or when you\u2019re dealing with complex generic types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var message = \"Hello\";          // inferred as string\n",
    "var count = 42;                 // inferred as int\n",
    "var list = new List<string>();  // inferred as List<string>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to convert a value from one type to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implicit conversion** happens automatically when no data loss is possible (e.g., `int` to `long`).\n",
    "- **Explicit conversion (casting)** requires a cast operator and may lose data (e.g., `double` to `int`).\n",
    "- **Helper classes** like `Convert` or methods like `ToString`, `Parse`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int intNumber = 100;\n",
    "long longNumber = intNumber;                // implicit\n",
    "\n",
    "double pi = 3.14159;\n",
    "int intPi = (int)pi;                        // explicit cast, result is 3 (truncated)\n",
    "\n",
    "string numberStr = \"123\";\n",
    "int parsed = int.Parse(numberStr);          // throws if invalid\n",
    "bool success = int.TryParse(numberStr, out int result); // safe parsing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nullable Value Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Value types cannot normally be `null`. To represent the absence of a value (e.g., a database field that can be null), use nullable value types with the `?` suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int? nullableInt = null;\n",
    "if (nullableInt.HasValue)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(nullableInt.Value);\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Or use the null-coalescing operator\n",
    "int actual = nullableInt ?? 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constants and Read-Only Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "- `const` \u2013 compile-time constant. Must be assigned at declaration and cannot be changed.\n",
    "- `readonly` \u2013 runtime constant. Can be assigned in the constructor and then never changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class MathUtility\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public const double PI = 3.14159;           // compile-time constant\n",
    "    public readonly double E;                    // instance readonly\n",
    "\n",
    "    public MathUtility()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        E = 2.71828; // assigned in constructor\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters for web apps:** In web applications, you\u2019ll constantly work with data: reading from databases, parsing request data, returning responses. A firm grasp of types and conversions prevents bugs and security issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Crash Course\n",
    "\n",
    "ASP.NET is built on OOP principles. Understanding classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism is non-negotiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (data) and methods (behavior). An **object** is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Fields (usually private)\n",
    "    private string _name;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Property with getter and setter\n",
    "    public string Name\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        get { return _name; }\n",
    "        set { _name = value; }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Auto-implemented property (compiler creates backing field)\n",
    "    public int Age { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Constructor\n",
    "    public Person(string name, int age)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Name = name;\n",
    "        Age = age;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Method\n",
    "    public void Introduce()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine($\"Hi, I'm {Name} and I'm {Age} years old.\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "var person = new Person(\"Bob\", 25);\n",
    "person.Introduce();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Properties** encapsulate fields with get and set accessors. Auto-properties simplify this when no extra logic is needed.\n",
    "- **Constructors** initialize the object. If you don\u2019t define one, a parameterless constructor exists (unless other constructors are defined).\n",
    "- **Methods** define behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Control visibility:\n",
    "- `public` \u2013 accessible anywhere.\n",
    "- `private` \u2013 accessible only within the same class.\n",
    "- `protected` \u2013 accessible within the same class or derived classes.\n",
    "- `internal` \u2013 accessible within the same assembly.\n",
    "- `protected internal` \u2013 accessible within same assembly or derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class to reuse, extend, or modify behavior of another class. C# supports single inheritance (a class can inherit from only one base class).\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Employee : Person  // Employee inherits from Person\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public string EmployeeId { get; set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Employee(string name, int age, string employeeId) \n",
    "        : base(name, age)       // call base class constructor\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        EmployeeId = employeeId;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Override method (must be virtual in base)\n",
    "    public override void Introduce()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        base.Introduce();       // call base implementation\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine($\"My employee ID is {EmployeeId}.\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the base class `Person`, we need to mark `Introduce` as `virtual` to allow overriding:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public virtual void Introduce() { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Employee emp = new Employee(\"Carol\", 30, \"E123\");\n",
    "emp.Introduce();  // calls overridden version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism** means \u201cmany forms.\u201d It allows you to treat objects of derived classes as objects of the base class, yet the correct overridden method is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Person p = new Employee(\"Dave\", 40, \"E456\");\n",
    "p.Introduce();   // still calls Employee.Introduce()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters for web apps:** You\u2019ll model your domain (e.g., User, Product, Order) using classes and inheritance. Frameworks like Entity Framework Core map these classes to database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Interfaces and Dependency Inversion (The \u201cD\u201d in SOLID)\n",
    "\n",
    "An **interface** defines a contract. It contains declarations of methods, properties, events, but no implementations. Classes that implement the interface must provide the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public interface IRepository<T>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    T GetById(int id);\n",
    "    void Add(T entity);\n",
    "    void Update(T entity);\n",
    "    void Delete(int id);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class ProductRepository : IRepository<Product>\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public Product GetById(int id)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // actual data access logic\n",
    "        return new Product();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void Add(Product entity) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "    public void Update(Product entity) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "    public void Delete(int id) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use interfaces?** They decouple the definition of \u201cwhat\u201d from \u201chow.\u201d Your business logic can depend on `IRepository<Product>` instead of the concrete `ProductRepository`. This enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testability:** You can mock the repository in unit tests.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** You can swap out the implementation (e.g., from SQL to a cloud API) without changing the code that uses it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependency Inversion Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dependency Inversion Principle states:\n",
    "1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces).\n",
    "2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you design your classes to receive their dependencies via constructors (Constructor Injection).\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class ProductService\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly IRepository<Product> _productRepository;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Dependency is injected, not created inside\n",
    "    public ProductService(IRepository<Product> productRepository)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _productRepository = productRepository;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Product GetProduct(int id)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        return _productRepository.GetById(id);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the `ProductService` doesn\u2019t know or care about the concrete repository. This is a cornerstone of modern ASP.NET Core applications, where the built-in Dependency Injection container wires everything together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code snippet with DI container registration (ASP.NET Core):**\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// In Program.cs or Startup.cs\n",
    "builder.Services.AddScoped<IRepository<Product>, ProductRepository>();\n",
    "builder.Services.AddScoped<ProductService>();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters for web apps:** It\u2019s the standard way to build maintainable, testable, and loosely coupled web applications. You\u2019ll see interfaces everywhere\u2014for logging, data access, email sending, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Asynchronous Programming: `async` and `await` (The Lifeline of Web Apps)\n",
    "\n",
    "Web servers handle many concurrent requests. If a request thread blocks while waiting for I/O (database query, file read, HTTP call), that thread cannot serve other requests. Asynchronous programming frees up threads during I/O, dramatically improving scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "C# makes async programming easy with `async` and `await` keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basics of `async` and `await`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mark a method with `async`.\n",
    "- Return `Task` or `Task<T>` (for methods that return a value).\n",
    "- Use `await` to asynchronously wait for an operation without blocking the thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public async Task<string> FetchDataAsync()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Simulate an HTTP request (non-blocking)\n",
    "    using var httpClient = new HttpClient();\n",
    "    string result = await httpClient.GetStringAsync(\"https://api.example.com/data\");\n",
    "    return result;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**\n",
    "- `await` doesn\u2019t block the thread; it tells the compiler to suspend the method until the awaited task completes, then resume.\n",
    "- While suspended, the thread returns to the thread pool to handle other requests.\n",
    "- When the task completes, the method resumes on any available thread (context captured by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calling an Async Method\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public async Task CallerMethod()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    string data = await FetchDataAsync();\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(data);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Handling in Async Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are captured in the returned task and thrown when you `await` the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "try\n",
    "{\n",
    "    string data = await FetchDataAsync();\n",
    "}\n",
    "catch (HttpRequestException ex)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // handle error\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Async in ASP.NET Controllers\n",
    "\n",
    "In ASP.NET Core, controller actions can be asynchronous. This is crucial for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "[ApiController]\n",
    "[Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\n",
    "public class ProductsController : ControllerBase\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private readonly ProductService _productService;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public ProductsController(ProductService productService)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _productService = productService;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\n",
    "    public async Task<ActionResult<Product>> GetProduct(int id)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        var product = await _productService.GetProductAsync(id);\n",
    "        if (product == null)\n",
    "            return NotFound();\n",
    "        return Ok(product);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules of thumb:**\n",
    "- Avoid `async void` (only for event handlers). Async methods should return `Task` or `Task<T>`.\n",
    "- Don\u2019t block on async code with `.Result` or `.Wait()`; that can cause deadlocks.\n",
    "- Name async methods with the \u201cAsync\u201d suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters for web apps:** Without async, a server with 100 threads can only handle 100 concurrent long-running I/O operations. With async, it can handle thousands. Async is not optional\u2014it\u2019s essential for modern web apps.\n",

    "\n",
    "Null references are a common source of bugs. C# 8 introduced nullable reference types to help you express your intent and reduce `NullReferenceException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nullable Reference Types\n",
    "\n",
    "When enabled, the compiler tracks whether a reference type variable might be `null`. You use `?` to mark a reference type as nullable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enable nullable context in your project file:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<PropertyGroup>\n",
    "  <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n",
    "</PropertyGroup>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or use `#nullable enable` in a file.\n",

    "#### Null-Forgiving Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "If you\u2019re sure a variable isn\u2019t null but the compiler can\u2019t prove it, use the `!` operator (null-forgiving).\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string name = nullable!;   // tell compiler: trust me, it's not null\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Null-Conditional Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `?.` operator safely accesses members. If the instance is null, the expression returns null.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string? city = person?.Address?.City;\n",
    "// If person or Address is null, city becomes null (no exception)\n",
    "```\n",

    "The `??` operator returns the left-hand value if not null; otherwise the right-hand value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string displayName = name ?? \"Anonymous\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Handling with Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are the standard way to handle errors in C#. Use `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can also create custom exception classes by deriving from `Exception`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class UserNotFoundException : Exception\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public UserNotFoundException(string userId) \n",
    "        : base($\"User with ID {userId} was not found.\") { }\n",

    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Use exceptions for exceptional conditions, not for control flow.\n",
    "- Log exceptions appropriately (we\u2019ll cover logging in Chapter 11).\n",
    "- In web apps, let the global exception handler (middleware) transform exceptions into proper HTTP responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters for web apps:** In a web environment, one unhandled null reference can crash an entire request. Modern C# features help you write safer code, and proper error handling ensures your app fails gracefully.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ve now covered the essential C# fundamentals that form the bedrock of every ASP.NET application:\n",
    "- **Syntax, types, and variables** \u2013 the building blocks.\n",
    "- **OOP concepts** \u2013 modeling your domain.\n",
    "- **Interfaces and dependency inversion** \u2013 writing decoupled, testable code.\n",
    "- **Async programming** \u2013 ensuring scalability.\n",
    "- **Nullable reference types and error handling** \u2013 writing robust code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we\u2019ll dive into how the web works and how ASP.NET Core processes HTTP requests. But first, practice these concepts: create a small console application that defines a few classes, uses an interface, and calls an async method. This hands-on experience will cement your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "1. Define a `Book` class with properties: `Title`, `Author`, `ISBN`, `Price`.\n",
    "2. Create an interface `IBookRepository` with methods `GetBookByIsbn(string isbn)`, `AddBook(Book book)`.\n",
    "3. Implement a simple in-memory `BookRepository`.\n",
    "4. Write a `BookService` that depends on `IBookRepository` and has a method `GetBookPrice(string isbn)`.\n",
    "5. Make the `GetBookPrice` async (simulate a delay with `Task.Delay`).\n",
    "6. Handle the case where the book is not found by throwing a custom exception.\n",
    "7. In your `Main` method, test the flow and catch the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will bring together all the topics we\u2019ve discussed. Good luck, and welcome to the world of C# and ASP.NET!"
