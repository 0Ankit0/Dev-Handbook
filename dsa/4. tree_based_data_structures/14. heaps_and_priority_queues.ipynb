    "\n",
    "A **priority queue** is an abstract data type where each element has a priority, and the element with the highest (or lowest) priority is always removed first. Unlike a FIFO queue, the order of removal is based on priority, not insertion order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority queues are fundamental in many algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dijkstra's shortest path** (extract node with minimum distance)\n",
    "- **Prim's minimum spanning tree** (extract edge with minimum weight)\n",
    "- **Huffman coding** (extract two smallest frequencies)\n",
    "- **Event-driven simulation** (process next event in time order)\n",
    "- **Load balancing** (serve highest priority task)\n",
    "- **Scheduling** (CPU, disk I/O)\n",

    "### **14.1.1 Heap: The Classic Implementation**\n",
