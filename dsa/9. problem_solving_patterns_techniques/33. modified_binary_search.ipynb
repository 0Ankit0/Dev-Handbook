    "\n",
    "Binary search is one of the most fundamental algorithms, but its true power extends far beyond simple \"find x in sorted array\" problems. **Modified binary search** refers to adapting the binary search idea to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find elements in partially sorted or rotated arrays.\n",
    "- Find boundaries (first/last occurrence).\n",
    "- Solve optimization problems where we search over a range of possible answers (parametric search).\n",
    "- Compute mathematical functions like square roots.\n",
    "- Find peaks in arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common thread is that we have a **monotonic predicate**: some condition is false for a prefix and true for the rest, or vice\u2011versa. By repeatedly dividing the search space, we can find the transition point efficiently.\n",
