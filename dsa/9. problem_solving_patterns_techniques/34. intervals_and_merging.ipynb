    "An **interval** is a range defined by a start and an end point. Intervals are used to model time spans, ranges, segments, and many other real-world concepts. Common operations on intervals include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Merging overlapping intervals** (e.g., combining meeting times)\n",
    "- **Inserting a new interval into an existing set**\n",
    "- **Checking if two intervals overlap**\n",
    "- **Finding gaps or coverage**\n",

To handle this, we can sort events by coordinate, and for ties, process +1 before -1 (or vice versa depending on definition). In the above, we just used integer addition; but if we have (start, +1) and (end, -1), and a start equals an end, the -1 would come first if we sort only by coordinate, which might undercount. Better to sort by (coordinate, type) with a custom order.\n",
