    "\n",
    "**Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**, also known as **Union-Find**, is a data structure that tracks a partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It supports two primary operations efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Find:** Determine which subset a particular element belongs to (often returning a representative or \"root\" of that subset).\n",
    "- **Union:** Merge two subsets into a single subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "DSU is fundamental in problems involving connectivity, especially in graphs, and is a key component of Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.\n",

    "The DSU maintains a forest of trees, where each tree represents a set. The root of each tree is the **representative** of that set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Find(x):** Follow parent pointers from x until reaching the root. Return the root.\n",
    "- **Union(x, y):** Find roots of x and y. If they are different, make one root the parent of the other, merging the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without optimizations, these operations can take O(n) time in the worst case (a skewed tree). With **path compression** and **union by rank**, they become nearly constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 28.2 Basic Implementation\n",
