    "\n",
    "In previous chapters, we covered fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and heaps, as well as more specialized ones like segment trees and Fenwick trees. This chapter delves into **advanced data structures** that offer unique capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Treaps:** A randomized binary search tree combining BST and heap properties.\n",
    "- **Splay Trees:** A self-adjusting BST with amortized logarithmic operations.\n",
    "- **Link-Cut Trees:** A structure for dynamic trees that supports link, cut, and path queries.\n",
    "- **Ordered Statistics Trees:** Augmented BSTs for rank and select operations.\n",
    "- **Sparse Table:** A static data structure for range minimum queries in O(1) after O(n log n) preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These structures are used in specialized contexts, such as network flow algorithms, dynamic connectivity, and problems requiring order statistics.\n",

    "## 29.2 Treaps (Randomized Binary Search Trees)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **treap** is a combination of a binary search tree (BST) and a heap. Each node has a key (maintaining BST order) and a randomly assigned priority (maintaining heap order: parent priority > child priorities). This randomization ensures the tree remains balanced with high probability, leading to expected O(log n) operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29.2.1 Definition and Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BST property:** For any node, left subtree keys < node.key < right subtree keys.\n",
    "- **Heap property:** For any node, priority(node) > priority(left child) and > priority(right child) (max-heap).\n",
    "- Priorities are assigned randomly (e.g., using a random number generator) upon insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because priorities are random, the expected height of a treap is O(log n), and operations are efficient in expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29.2.2 Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insertion\n",
    "1. Insert node as in a normal BST.\n",
    "2. Then rotate it up (like in a heap) until heap property is restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deletion\n",
    "1. Find the node.\n",
    "2. If it has two children, rotate it down with the child of higher priority until it becomes a leaf, then remove.\n",
    "3. If it has one child or none, simply replace it with its child.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Link-Cut Trees** (also known as **dynamic trees**) maintain a forest of rooted trees that can be modified by linking and cutting edges. They support operations like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `link(u, v)`: Add edge between u and v, making v a child of u (assuming they are in different trees).\n",
    "- `cut(u, v)`: Remove edge between u and v.\n",
