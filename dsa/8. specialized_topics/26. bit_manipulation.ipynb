    "    print(\"odd\")\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    return x > 0 and (x & (x - 1)) == 0\n",
    "```\n",

    "Because powers of two have exactly one bit set; `x-1` flips all lower bits, so AND becomes zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def count_trailing_zeros(x):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, use a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 26.3.10 Count leading zeros\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `x.bit_length()` gives number of bits needed to represent x, so leading zeros = total bits (e.g., 32) minus `bit_length()` if we consider fixed width.\n",

    "b = a ^ b\n",
    "a = a ^ b\n",
