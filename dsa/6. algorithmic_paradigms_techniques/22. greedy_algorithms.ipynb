    "**Greedy algorithms** build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. Unlike backtracking which explores multiple options, greedy algorithms make a single sequence of irrevocable decisions.\n",

    "\n",
    "A greedy algorithm is correct for a problem if it exhibits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Greedy Choice Property:** A globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal (greedy) choice.\n",
    "2. **Optimal Substructure:** An optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems.\n",
