    "\n",
    "A **minimum spanning tree (MST)** of a connected, undirected, weighted graph is a subset of edges that connects all vertices together without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. MSTs are fundamental in network design, clustering, and approximation algorithms.\n",

    "### 18.1.1 Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a connected, undirected graph G = (V, E) with a weight function w: E \u2192 \u211d, a **spanning tree** T \u2286 E is a set of |V|-1 edges that connects all vertices without cycles. A **minimum spanning tree** is a spanning tree with the smallest possible sum of edge weights.\n",

    "\n",
    "Build MST of data points (using Euclidean distance as weight), then remove the k-1 heaviest edges to obtain k clusters. This is **single-linkage clustering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.6.3 Approximation Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):** For metric TSP (triangle inequality), an MST-based algorithm (double the tree, then shortcut) gives a 2-approximation.\n",
    "- **Steiner tree problem:** MST on metric closure gives 2-approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.6.4 Image Segmentation\n",

    "Find a minimum-weight tree connecting a subset of vertices (terminals), possibly using additional vertices (Steiner points). This is NP-hard, but MST gives a 2-approximation in metric spaces.\n",
