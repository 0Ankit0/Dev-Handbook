    "## 17.1 Introduction to Shortest Path Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the shortest path between vertices in a graph is one of the most fundamental and widely applicable problems in computer science. It underpins everything from GPS navigation and network routing to social network analysis and game development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.1.1 Problem Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortest path problems come in several flavors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP):** Find shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices.\n",
    "- **Single-Destination Shortest Path:** Find shortest paths from all vertices to a given destination (equivalent to SSSP on reversed graph).\n",
    "- **All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP):** Find shortest paths between every pair of vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.1.2 Graph Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of algorithm depends heavily on graph properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unweighted graphs:** BFS solves SSSP in O(V+E).\n",
    "- **Weighted graphs without negative edges:** Dijkstra's algorithm is the classic choice.\n",
    "- **Graphs with negative weights (but no negative cycles):** Bellman-Ford or SPFA.\n",
    "- **Graphs with negative cycles:** Detectable but no finite shortest path exists (paths can be arbitrarily negative).\n",
    "- **Dense graphs vs sparse graphs:** Floyd-Warshall (O(V\u00b3)) works for dense graphs; Johnson's algorithm (O(VE + V\u00b2 log V)) is better for sparse all-pairs.\n",

    "\n",
    "The algorithm relies on the invariant that when a vertex is popped from the priority queue with the smallest distance, that distance is final because all edges have non-negative weights. Any alternative path would have to go through vertices with larger distances, making it longer.\n",

    "1. **GPS Navigation:** Dijkstra or A* on road networks (with heuristics like Euclidean distance).\n",
    "2. **Network Routing Protocols:** OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) uses Dijkstra; RIP uses distance-vector (Bellman-Ford variant).\n",
    "3. **Social Networks:** Shortest path (unweighted) gives degrees of separation.\n",
    "4. **Flight Scheduling:** Find cheapest or fastest itinerary (may involve negative weights for layovers).\n",

    "6. **Robotics Path Planning:** A* on grid or configuration space.\n",

    "### Problem 1: Network Delay Time (LeetCode 743)\n",
    "You are given a network of n nodes and a list of times (u \u2192 v, t). Find the time it takes for all nodes to receive a signal sent from a given node k. Return -1 if not all nodes reachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Single-source shortest path (Dijkstra). Return max of distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 2: Cheapest Flights Within K Stops (LeetCode 787)\n",
    "Find cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. Graph may have negative weights? Usually not. Use Bellman-Ford with k+1 iterations (relax edges only k+1 times) to respect stop count.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 3: Path with Maximum Probability (LeetCode 1514)\n",
    "Given undirected weighted graph with probabilities on edges, find path with maximum product of probabilities from start to end.\n",

    "Given a sorted dictionary, find order of characters. Build graph, topological sort (Kahn). If cycle exists, invalid.\n",

    "**Hint:** This is not directly shortest path, but uses graph traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 8: Find the Safest Path in a Grid (Similar to LeetCode 778)\n",
    "Given grid with values, find path minimizing maximum value along path (minimax path). Can be solved with Dijkstra variant using max of edge weights.\n",

    "Given bus routes (list of stops), find minimum number of buses to go from source to target. Model as graph where stops are vertices and buses connect all stops on same route (with weight 1 if boarding a bus). Then BFS.\n",
