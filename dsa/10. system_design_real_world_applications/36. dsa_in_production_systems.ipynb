    "While the previous chapters focused on the theory and implementation of data structures, this chapter bridges the gap to real\u2011world engineering. In production systems, we face constraints such as massive scale, concurrency, fault tolerance, and hardware limitations. The data structures we choose must not only be asymptotically efficient but also perform well under these conditions.\n",

    "## 36.2 Database Indexing Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases rely on indexing to provide fast access to data without scanning entire tables. Two dominant index structures are **B+ Trees** and **LSM Trees**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 36.2.1 B+ Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "B+ trees are the standard index structure in relational databases (MySQL InnoDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle). They are a variant of B\u2011trees where all data resides in leaves, and internal nodes only store keys (routing information). Leaves are linked for efficient range scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why B+ Trees?**\n",
    "- **High fanout:** Each node holds many keys (order = block size / key size), so the tree height is small (typically 3\u20134 levels even for billions of rows).\n",
    "- **Disk\u2011optimized:** Nodes correspond to disk pages, minimizing I/O.\n",
    "- **Range queries:** Leaf linkage allows sequential scans without going back up the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operations:**\n",
    "- **Search:** Follow path from root to leaf; one disk read per level.\n",
    "- **Insert:** Find leaf, insert key; if leaf overflows, split and propagate.\n",
    "- **Delete:** Find leaf, remove key; if underflow, borrow from sibling or merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (conceptual):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Root: [50, 100]\n",
    "         /    |    \\\n",
    "    [10,20] [60,70] [110,120]   (internal nodes)\n",

    "    [10,20] [60,70]  [110,120]  (leaves linked)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 36.2.2 LSM Trees (Log\u2011Structured Merge Trees)\n",
    "\n",
    "LSM trees are used in modern NoSQL databases (Cassandra, RocksDB, LevelDB) and are optimized for high write throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "- **Memtable:** An in\u2011memory balanced tree (often a skip list or red\u2011black tree) that accepts writes. Writes are appended to a write\u2011ahead log (WAL) for durability.\n",
    "- **SSTables (Sorted String Tables):** When the memtable is full, it is flushed to disk as an immutable SSTable. Each SSTable is a sorted file.\n",
    "- **Compaction:** Background process merges SSTables to keep the number of files manageable and to remove deleted or outdated entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Write\u2011optimized:** Writes are O(log n) in\u2011memory and then sequential disk writes.\n",
    "- **Reads:** May need to check multiple SSTables; **bloom filters** are often used to avoid checking files that definitely do not contain the key.\n",
    "- **Space amplification:** Compaction trades off write amplification for read performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade\u2011offs:**\n",
    "- Read amplification (checking multiple files) can be high, mitigated by caching and bloom filters.\n",
    "- Compaction consumes I/O and CPU.\n",
    "\n",
