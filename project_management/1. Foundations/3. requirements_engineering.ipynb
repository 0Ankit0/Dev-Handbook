    "## **Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distinguish between functional and non-functional requirements and explain why both are critical\n",
    "- Write effective user stories using the standard user story format\n",
    "- Apply the INVEST criteria to evaluate and improve requirement quality\n",
    "- Use prioritization techniques like MoSCoW, Kano Model, and WSJF to make informed scope decisions\n",
    "- Create structured requirements documentation that guides development and testing\n",
    "- Manage changing requirements throughout the project lifecycle while maintaining project focus\n",

    "## **Real-World Case Study: The Requirements That Weren't**\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2023, a startup called HealthApp set out to build a telemedicine platform. The product vision was clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Build an app that connects patients with doctors for video consultations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The team gathered basic requirements, created a backlog, and started development. Six months and $1.2 million later, they launched.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Launch Day Disaster:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario 1**: An elderly patient tried to use the app but couldn't navigate the interface. The team had never considered accessibility requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario 2**: A patient in a rural area couldn't connect due to poor internet. The team had assumed everyone had high-speed broadband.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario 3**: During a consultation, a doctor needed to access the patient's medical records but couldn't. Integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems had never been discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario 4**: A patient's payment failed, but the system didn't notify either party. Error handling requirements were missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario 5**: On day one, the app crashed when 500 users tried to video call simultaneously. Performance requirements had never been defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Root Cause:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The team had gathered **functional requirements** (what the system should do) but completely neglected:\n",
    "- **Non-functional requirements** (how well it should do it)\n",
    "- **User experience requirements** (how it should feel)\n",
    "- **Integration requirements** (how it should connect)\n",
    "- **Performance requirements** (how fast/scalable it should be)\n",
    "- **Accessibility requirements** (who should be able to use it)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Aftermath:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project was reinitiated with proper requirements engineering, adding another 4 months and $800,000 to the budget. Competitors who had launched later with better requirements quickly overtook them in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Lesson:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements engineering isn't about listing features\u2014it's about understanding the complete picture of what you're building, for whom, and under what conditions. Incomplete or poorly defined requirements are the #1 cause of project failures, rework, and budget overruns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3.1 Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Are Requirements?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A requirement is a documented need that must be met by a system, product, or service. Requirements define what stakeholders need and what the system must deliver.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Requirement Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A requirement is:\n",
    "\u251c\u2500 A documented need or expectation\n",
    "\u251c\u2500 Something the system must provide or do\n",
    "\u251c\u2500 A condition or capability that must be met\n",
    "\u251c\u2500 Derived from stakeholder needs\n",
    "\u2514\u2500 The foundation for design, development, and testing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Requirements Matter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Research shows:**\n",
    "> - 68% of project failures are attributed to inadequate requirements\n",
    "> - Fixing a requirement defect during implementation costs 10-100x more than during requirements gathering\n",
    "> - Every dollar spent on requirements saves $10-100 in rework costs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Functional Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional requirements describe what the system must do. They define the behaviors, functions, and features of the system from the user's perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of Functional Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Functional Requirements:\n",
    "\u251c\u2500 Describe system behaviors\n",
    "\u251c\u2500 Define inputs and outputs\n",
    "\u251c\u2500 Specify business rules\n",
    "\u251c\u2500 Outline user interactions\n",
    "\u251c\u2500 Define feature functionality\n",
    "\u2514\u2500 Can be verified through testing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of Functional Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example 1: User Authentication\n",
    "\"The system shall allow users to register using email and password.\"\n",
    "\"The system shall verify email addresses before activating accounts.\"\n",
    "\"The system shall allow users to reset passwords via email.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Shopping Cart\n",
    "\"The system shall allow users to add items to a shopping cart.\"\n",
    "\"The system shall calculate and display the total cart value.\"\n",
    "\"The system shall allow users to remove items from the cart.\"\n",
    "\"The system shall save cart contents for logged-in users.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3: Payment Processing\n",
    "\"The system shall accept credit card payments.\"\n",
    "\"The system shall validate payment information before processing.\"\n",
    "\"The system shall generate and display payment confirmation.\"\n",
    "\"The system shall send email receipts to customers.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional Requirement Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Well-written functional requirements follow this structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Actor] shall [action] [object] [condition/constraint]\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- \"The system shall allow users to reset passwords when they have forgotten them.\"\n",
    "- \"The admin shall be able to view all user accounts only after logging in.\"\n",
    "- \"The payment gateway shall process transactions only if payment information is valid.\"\n",

    "| Aspect | Functional Requirements | Non-Functional Requirements |\n",
    "|--------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n",
    "| **What it describes** | What the system does | How the system behaves |\n",
    "| **Focus** | Features and behaviors | Quality attributes |\n",
    "| **Examples** | Login, search, checkout | Performance, security, scalability |\n",
    "| **Verification** | Functional testing | Non-functional testing |\n",
    "| **Stakeholders** | End users, business owners | System architects, operations |\n",

    "| **Priority** | Often business-driven | Often technical-driven |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Both are Essential**: Functional requirements define what you're building, but non-functional requirements determine whether it's usable, secure, and performant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interdependency**: Functional and non-functional requirements often interact. For example, a complex search feature (functional) may impact performance (non-functional).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Different Stakeholders**: Different stakeholders care about different requirements. Users care about functional features; operations teams care about non-functional qualities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing Approaches**: Functional requirements are tested through functional testing (does it work?). Non-functional requirements are tested through specialized testing (how well does it work?).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Trade-offs**: Non-functional requirements often involve trade-offs. For example, higher security may reduce performance, or higher scalability may increase cost.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Managing Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Balance Both Types**:\n",
    "   - Don't focus only on functional requirements\n",
    "   - Allocate sufficient time to define non-functional requirements\n",
    "   - Ensure stakeholders understand both types\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make Them Measurable**:\n",
    "   - Write requirements that can be verified\n",
    "   - Include specific metrics and criteria\n",
    "   - Avoid vague or subjective requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prioritize Appropriately**:\n",
    "   - Not all requirements are equally important\n",
    "   - Use prioritization techniques for both types\n",
    "   - Focus on critical requirements first\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trace Them Through Development**:\n",
    "   - Maintain traceability from requirements to tests\n",
    "   - Ensure all requirements are covered by tests\n",
    "   - Verify requirements are met before release\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Review and Update Regularly**:\n",
    "   - Requirements change as understanding evolves\n",
    "   - Review requirements periodically\n",

    "   \u251c\u2500 Directly proportional to satisfaction\n",
    "   \u251c\u2500 More features = more satisfaction\n",

    "   \u2514\u2500 Example: Personalized product recommendations\n",

    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we've explored the fundamentals of requirements engineering\u2014the foundation of successful software projects. Let's recap the key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements**:\n",
    "   - Functional requirements describe what the system does\n",
    "   - Non-functional requirements describe how the system behaves\n",
    "   - Both are critical for project success\n",
    "   - Each has different characteristics and testing approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Stories, Use Cases, and Job Stories**:\n",
    "   - User stories are short, simple descriptions from user perspective\n",
    "   - Use cases provide detailed interaction flows\n",
    "   - Job stories focus on motivation and context\n",
    "   - Choose format based on purpose and audience\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **INVEST Criteria**:\n",
    "   - Independent: Can be developed independently\n",
    "   - Negotiable: Can be discussed and adjusted\n",
    "   - Valuable: Delivers value to stakeholders\n",
    "   - Estimable: Can be estimated accurately\n",
    "   - Small: Can be completed in one iteration\n",
    "   - Testable: Can be verified through testing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prioritization Techniques**:\n",
    "   - MoSCoW: Categorize into Must, Should, Could, Won't\n",
    "   - Kano Model: Classify by customer satisfaction impact\n",
    "   - WSJF: Prioritize by cost of delay and job size\n",
    "   - Choose technique based on project needs\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Review Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How do functional and non-functional requirements differ in testing approaches?** Give examples of how you would test each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **When would you use a use case instead of a user story?** Provide specific scenarios where each format is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How can you make a vague requirement like \"make the system faster\" testable?** Apply the INVEST criteria to improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare and contrast MoSCoW, Kano Model, and WSJF.** In what situations would you choose each technique?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **You have a requirement that's dependent on three other requirements. How does this violate the INVEST criteria, and how would you address it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **A stakeholder wants to add a feature that's \"nice to have\" but will take 3 weeks to implement. How would you prioritize it using MoSCoW, Kano Model, and WSJF?**\n",

    "## **Practical Exercise: Requirements Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**: You're gathering requirements for a mobile fitness tracking app. The app should allow users to track workouts, monitor progress, and connect with friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task**:\n",
    "1. **Identify Requirements**:\n",
    "   - List at least 10 functional requirements\n",
    "   - List at least 5 non-functional requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write User Stories**:\n",
    "   - Write user stories for your functional requirements\n",
    "   - Include acceptance criteria for each story\n",
    "   - Apply the INVEST criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a Use Case**:\n",
    "   - Choose one complex requirement\n",
    "   - Create a detailed use case with main and alternative flows\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prioritize Using MoSCoW**:\n",
    "   - Categorize your requirements using MoSCoW\n",
    "   - Justify each categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Apply the Kano Model**:\n",
    "   - Classify your requirements using Kano categories\n",
    "   - Identify at least one \"delighter\" feature\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverable**: Create a requirements document that includes all five components. Review it with peers and get feedback on completeness and quality.\n",

    "## **Chapter 4 Preview**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Chapter 4: Estimation and Sizing**, we'll dive deep into the art and science of estimating software development effort and creating realistic schedules. You'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand why software estimation is challenging and prone to error\n",
    "- Apply various estimation techniques from simple to sophisticated\n",
    "- Use story points, planning poker, and three-point estimation effectively\n",
