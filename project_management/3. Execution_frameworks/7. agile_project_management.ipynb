    "## **Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement Scrum framework with proper roles, artifacts, and events for software development\n",
    "- Design and optimize Kanban systems using WIP limits and pull-based workflows\n",
    "- Apply Extreme Programming (XP) practices to improve code quality and team collaboration\n",
    "- Scale Agile practices across multiple teams using SAFe, LeSS, Nexus, or Spotify models\n",
    "- Create automated checklists and tools to support Agile ceremonies and workflows\n",

    "\n",
    "Sarah joined \"TechCorp\" as a Project Manager for a struggling 20-person development team. The team was using \"Agile\"\u2014they had daily stand-ups, called their work \"stories,\" and used Jira\u2014but they were delivering poorly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sprints**: 2 weeks long, but always \"almost done\" at the end\n",
    "- **Stand-ups**: 45-minute problem-solving sessions where only 3 people talked\n",
    "- **Stories**: \"Fix the thing\" with no acceptance criteria\n",
    "- **Retrospectives**: Complaint sessions with no action items\n",
    "- **Velocity**: Inconsistent, unpredictable, declining\n",
    "\n",
    "The team was burned out. The product owner was frustrated. The executives wanted to return to \"waterfall\" because \"at least we knew what was happening.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Sarah's challenge: Transform this into a high-performing Agile team without losing the people or the product.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **What Scrum Actually Is**\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrum is a lightweight framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is not a methodology, not a process, and not a technique. It is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Scrum Theory**:\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome\n",
    "- **Inspection**: Frequent inspection of progress toward goals to detect undesirable variances\n",
    "- **Adaptation**: Adjusting the process or product as soon as inspection reveals deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Scrum Team**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Developers (The \"How\")**\n",
    "- Cross-functional (all skills needed to create the product increment)\n",
    "- Self-managing (no one tells them how to turn Product Backlog into Increments)\n",
    "- Typically 3-9 people (fewer = slower, more = coordination overhead)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anti-patterns to avoid**:\n",
    "- \"Frontend team\" and \"Backend team\" (not cross-functional)\n",
    "- \"Scrum team\" that needs approval from external architects (not self-managing)\n",
    "- 15 \"developers\" with only 3 actually coding (team too large)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Product Owner (The \"What\")**\n",
    "- Accountable for maximizing product value\n",
    "- Manages the Product Backlog (content, ordering, communication)\n",
    "- One person, not a committee (can represent stakeholders, but decides alone)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anti-patterns**:\n",
    "- \"Proxy PO\" who has to ask the real PO for every decision\n",
    "- PO who only writes specs, doesn't prioritize\n",
    "- Committee of business analysts acting as \"the PO team\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Scrum Master (The \"Process\")**\n",
    "- Accountable for Scrum effectiveness\n",
    "- Coaches the team, PO, and organization in Scrum\n",
    "- Removes impediments (or teaches the team to remove them)\n",
    "- Servant leader, not a manager or project coordinator\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anti-patterns**:\n",
    "- Scrum Master who assigns tasks\n",
    "- \"Scrum Master\" who is also the Product Owner (conflict of interest)\n",
    "- Scrum Master who just schedules meetings and takes notes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scrum Artifacts**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Product Backlog**\n",
    "An ordered list of everything needed in the product. The single source of truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- **Dynamic**: Constantly updated (never \"complete\")\n",
    "- **Ordered**: By value, risk, priority, necessity (not just \"priority 1, 2, 3\")\n",
    "- **Transparent**: Everyone can see it\n",
    "- **Estimated**: Items have size estimates (story points or time)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refinement (Grooming)**:\n",
    "- Ongoing activity (not a specific event)\n",
    "- Adding detail, estimates, and order to backlog items\n",
    "- Typically consumes up to 10% of Development Team capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Sprint Backlog**\n",
    "The set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components**:\n",
    "- **Sprint Goal**: A single objective for the Sprint (why we're doing this work)\n",
    "- **Selected Backlog Items**: What will be delivered\n",
    "- **Plan**: How the work will be done (tasks, technical approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- **Owned by Developers**: Only they can change it during the Sprint\n",
    "- **Real-time**: Updated throughout the Sprint as work is discovered\n",
    "- **Visible**: Usually on a physical or digital board\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Increment**\n",
    "A concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition of Done (DoD)**:\n",
    "A formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example DoD for a Software Team**:\n",
    "- Code written and peer-reviewed\n",
    "- Unit tests written and passing (>80% coverage)\n",
    "- Integration tests passing\n",
    "- Code merged to main branch\n",
    "- Deployed to staging environment\n",
    "- Product Owner accepts the functionality\n",
    "- Documentation updated\n",
    "- No critical or high-severity bugs\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scrum Events**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The Sprint**\n",
    "A time-box of one month or less during which a \"Done,\" usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sprint Rules**:\n",
    "- **Fixed duration**: Never extend a Sprint (\"we need one more day\")\n",
    "- **Consistent length**: Same duration for all Sprints (predictability)\n",
    "- **No changes**: No changes that endanger the Sprint Goal\n",
    "- **Scope clarification**: Scope may be clarified and renegotiated between PO and Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Sprint Planning**\n",
    "Time-boxed to a maximum of 8 hours for a one-month Sprint (shorter for shorter Sprints).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topics**:\n",
    "1. **Why is this Sprint valuable?** (PO proposes, whole team collaborates on Sprint Goal)\n",
    "2. **What can be Done this Sprint?** (Developers select items from Product Backlog)\n",
    "3. **How will the chosen work get done?** (Developers plan the work necessary to create the Increment)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Daily Scrum**\n",
    "A 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "- Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal\n",
    "- Adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary\n",
    "- Create an actionable plan for the next day of work\n",
    "\n",
    "**Format** (not required by Scrum, but common):\n",
    "- What did I do yesterday that helped the team meet the Sprint Goal?\n",
    "- What will I do today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal?\n",
    "- Do I see any impediments that prevent me or the team from meeting the Sprint Goal?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anti-patterns**:\n",
    "- Status report to Scrum Master (should be team conversation)\n",
    "- Problem-solving session (take it offline after the 15 minutes)\n",
    "- Only 3 people talking (everyone should participate)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Sprint Review**\n",
    "Time-boxed to 4 hours for a one-month Sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "- Inspect the outcome of the Sprint\n",
    "- Determine future adaptations\n",
    "- Demonstrate working software to stakeholders\n",
    "- Collaborate on what to do next\n",
    "\n",
    "**Participants**: Scrum Team + key stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key difference from \"demo\"**: It's a working session, not just a presentation. Stakeholders provide feedback that affects the Product Backlog.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Sprint Retrospective**\n",
    "Time-boxed to 3 hours for a one-month Sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "- Inspect how the last Sprint went\n",
    "- Identify improvements\n",
    "- Create a plan for implementing improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope**: People, relationships, process, tools\u2014anything that affects how the Scrum Team works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key**: Actionable improvements. Every retrospective should produce at least one concrete action item for the next Sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Management Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Scrum But... (Anti-patterns)**\n",
    "Common \"modifications\" that break Scrum:\n",
    "- \"We do Scrum, but we don't have a Product Owner\" (No one owns value)\n",
    "- \"We do Scrum, but our Sprints are 6 weeks\" (Loses feedback loop)\n",
    "- \"We do Scrum, but the manager assigns tasks\" (Not self-managing)\n",
    "- \"We do Scrum, but we skip retrospectives\" (No improvement)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Metrics That Matter**\n",
    "- **Velocity**: Trend over time, not absolute number (for capacity planning)\n",
    "- **Sprint Goal Success**: Did we achieve what we set out to do?\n",
    "- **Cycle Time**: How long from start to finish for a story?\n",
    "- **Escaped Defects**: Bugs found in production (quality indicator)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Scaling Considerations**\n",
    "When one Scrum Team isn't enough:\n",
    "- **Nexus**: 3-9 Scrum Teams working on one product\n",
    "- **LeSS**: Large-Scale Scrum (up to a few thousand people)\n",
    "- **SAFe**: Scaled Agile Framework (enterprise scale)\n",
    "- **Spotify Model**: Squads, Tribes, Chapters, Guilds\n",

    "## **7.2 Kanban and Flow Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Origins and Philosophy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kanban (\u770b\u677f), Japanese for \"visual signal\" or \"card,\" originated in Toyota's manufacturing system. David Anderson adapted it for knowledge work (IT, software development) in the mid-2000s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Principles**:\n",
    "1. **Start with what you do now**: No revolutionary change required\n",
    "2. **Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change**: Small improvements continuously\n",
    "3. **Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities, and titles**: People over process\n",
    "4. **Leadership at all levels**: Everyone can suggest improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Kanban Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Six Core Practices**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Visualize the Workflow**\n",
    "Make work visible on a board with columns representing stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "| Backlog | Ready | In Dev | Review | Test | Done |\n",
    "|---------|-------|--------|--------|------|------|\n",
    "| Story 5 |Story 3|Story 2 |Story 1 |      |Story 4|\n",
    "| Story 6 |       |Story 7 |        |      |      |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**\n",
    "Set explicit limits on how many items can be in each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "| Backlog | Ready | In Dev | Review | Test | Done |\n",
    "|---------|-------|--------|--------|------|------|\n",
    "| Story 5 |Story 3|Story 2 |Story 1 |      |Story 4|\n",
    "| Story 6 |       |Story 7 |        |      |      |\n",
    "|         |       |        |        |      |      |\n",
    "[WIP: \u221e]  [WIP:4] [WIP:2]  [WIP:2]  [WIP:3] [WIP:\u221e]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why WIP Limits Matter**:\n",
    "- **Little's Law**: Average Cycle Time = Average Work in Progress / Average Throughput\n",
    "- **Focus**: Fewer things in progress = faster completion\n",
    "- **Quality**: Rushed context switching creates defects\n",
    "- **Predictability**: Stable flow is easier to forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Manage Flow**\n",
    "Monitor and optimize the smooth movement of work through the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow Metrics**:\n",
    "- **Cycle Time**: Start to finish for one item\n",
    "- **Lead Time**: Request to delivery (includes queue time)\n",
    "- **Throughput**: Items completed per time period\n",
    "- **Flow Efficiency**: Active work time / Total time (often 5-15% in knowledge work!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Make Process Policies Explicit**\n",
    "Document and visualize the rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Definition of Ready (to enter \"In Dev\"):\n",
    "- Acceptance criteria defined\n",
    "- Story estimated\n",
    "- Dependencies identified\n",
    "- UI mockups attached (if needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition of Done (to enter \"Done\"):\n",
    "- Code reviewed\n",
    "- Tests passing (>80% coverage)\n",
    "- Deployed to staging\n",
    "- PO accepts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Implement Feedback Loops**\n",
    "Regular cadences for improvement:\n",
    "- **Daily Standup**: Flow optimization\n",
    "- **Replenishment**: Selecting new work\n",
    "- **Service Delivery Review**: Checking service levels\n",
    "- **Operations Review**: Process improvement\n",
    "- **Risk Review**: Identifying blockers\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally**\n",
    "Use the scientific method:\n",
    "- **Observe**: \"Our cycle time increased\"\n",
    "- **Hypothesize**: \"It's because we increased WIP limit\"\n",
    "- **Experiment**: \"Reduce WIP limit from 5 to 3 for 2 weeks\"\n",
    "- **Measure**: \"Cycle time decreased by 20%\"\n",
    "- **Decide**: \"Keep the new WIP limit\"\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Kanban vs. Scrum**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Scrum | Kanban |\n",
    "|--------|-------|--------|\n",
    "| **Cadence** | Fixed Sprints (1-4 weeks) | Continuous flow |\n",
    "| **Roles** | PO, SM, Developers | No prescribed roles |\n",
    "| **Change** | No changes during Sprint | Change anytime |\n",
    "| **Metrics** | Velocity, Sprint Burndown | Cycle Time, Flow |\n",
    "| **Commitment** | Sprint Goal | Service Level Expectations |\n",
    "| **Best for** | Product development, feature teams | Support, maintenance, continuous delivery |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hybrid Approach (Scrumban)**:\n",
    "- Use Scrum's structure (Sprints, Roles) with Kanban's flow visualization\n",
    "- WIP limits within Sprints\n",

    "## **7.3 Extreme Programming (XP) Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Philosophy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Extreme Programming (XP), created by Kent Beck in the late 1990s, takes good practices to \"extreme\" levels. If code review is good, do it all the time (pair programming). If testing is good, write tests first (TDD).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Values**:\n",
    "1. **Communication**: Face-to-face conversation, not documentation\n",
    "2. **Simplicity**: Do the simplest thing that could possibly work\n",
    "3. **Feedback**: Rapid feedback through testing, customer involvement\n",
    "4. **Courage**: Refactor mercilessly, throw away bad code\n",
    "5. **Respect**: Respect for team members and the work\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Pair Programming**\n",
    "Two developers at one workstation:\n",
    "- **Driver**: Writes code, thinks tactically\n",
    "- **Navigator**: Reviews code, thinks strategically, catches errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- Real-time code review\n",
    "- Knowledge sharing (no single point of failure)\n",
    "- Higher quality (studies show fewer defects)\n",
    "- Focus (harder to check email when pairing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use**:\n",
    "- Complex business logic\n",
    "- Critical security code\n",
    "- Onboarding new team members\n",
    "- Knowledge silos (bus factor of 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**\n",
    "Red-Green-Refactor cycle:\n",
    "1. **Red**: Write a failing test\n",
    "2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass\n",
    "3. **Refactor**: Clean up while tests pass\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- Executable specifications\n",
    "- Confidence to refactor\n",
    "- Design feedback (hard to test = bad design)\n",
    "- Regression safety net\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Continuous Integration (CI)**\n",
    "Integrate code to main branch at least daily:\n",
    "- Automated builds on every commit\n",
    "- Automated tests run\n",
    "- Fix immediately if build breaks (stop the line)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Refactoring**\n",
    "Improving code without changing behavior:\n",
    "- Continuous design improvement\n",
    "- Eliminate duplication\n",
    "- Improve names\n",
    "- Split large functions\n",
    "- Remove technical debt\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Simple Design**\n",
    "Four rules (in priority order):\n",
    "1. Runs all the tests\n",
    "2. Expresses every idea we need to express\n",
    "3. Says everything once and only once (DRY)\n",
    "4. Has no superfluous parts (YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It)\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Collective Code Ownership**\n",
    "Anyone can change any code anywhere:\n",
    "- No \"my code\" vs \"your code\"\n",
    "- Everyone responsible for quality\n",
    "- Prevents bottlenecks (not waiting for \"the expert\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Continuous Deployment (CD)**\n",
    "Automatically deploy passing code to production:\n",
    "- Reduces release anxiety (small changes, frequent)\n",
    "- Fast feedback from real users\n",
    "- Requires robust automated testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. On-Site Customer**\n",
    "Business expert available to the team:\n",
    "- Immediate answers to questions\n",
    "- Acceptance testing\n",
    "- Real-time requirements clarification\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Coding Standards**\n",
    "Agreed-upon conventions:\n",
    "- Consistent formatting (automated with Prettier/Black)\n",
    "- Naming conventions\n",
    "- Architectural standards\n",
    "- Enforced by CI/CD\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Sustainable Pace**\n",
    "40-hour weeks, no heroics:\n",
    "- Burnout kills quality\n",
    "- Consistent velocity over time\n",
    "- Overtime is a sign of failed planning, not dedication\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **XP in Modern Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many XP practices are now standard:\n",
    "- TDD is mainstream\n",
    "- CI/CD is DevOps standard\n",
    "- Pair programming is common for complex tasks\n",
    "- Refactoring is recognized as essential\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use full XP**:\n",
    "- High-risk projects\n",
    "- Requirements changing rapidly\n",
    "- Quality is critical (financial, medical)\n",

    "When you have more than 9 developers, coordination becomes difficult:\n",
    "- One Product Owner can't know all the details\n",
    "- Daily Scrums become too long\n",
    "- Dependencies between teams multiply\n",

    "**Structure**:\n",
    "- 3-9 Scrum Teams working on one product\n",
    "- One Product Owner for all teams\n",
    "- One Nexus Sprint Backlog (aggregation of team backlogs)\n",
    "- One Integrated Increment (all teams integrate daily)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Events**:\n",
    "- **Nexus Sprint Planning**: Teams plan together, identify dependencies\n",
    "- **Nexus Daily Scrum**: Representatives from each team meet to identify integration issues\n",
    "- **Nexus Sprint Review**: All teams demo integrated increment together\n",
    "- **Nexus Sprint Retrospective**: Cross-team improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for**: Single product, co-located or similar time zones, strong technical practices (CI/CD).\n",

    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter covered the practical implementation of Agile methodologies in software development, from single-team Scrum to enterprise scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scrum Framework**:\n",
    "   - Three roles with clear accountability: PO (value), SM (process), Developers (execution)\n",
    "   - Five events with timeboxes: Sprint, Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, Retrospective\n",
    "   - Three artifacts with commitment: Product Backlog (no commitment), Sprint Backlog (Sprint Goal), Increment (DoD)\n",
    "   - The Sprint Goal is the commitment, not the scope\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Kanban Flow Management**:\n",
    "   - Visualize workflow, limit WIP, manage flow\n",
    "   - Use WIP limits to optimize cycle time (Little's Law)\n",
    "   - Make policies explicit and evolve experimentally\n",
    "   - Focus on continuous delivery rather than timeboxed batches\n",
    "   - Measure flow metrics: cycle time, throughput, flow efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extreme Programming (XP)**:\n",
    "   - Technical practices that enable Agile: TDD, pair programming, CI/CD\n",
    "   - Values: Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage, Respect\n",
    "   - Practices support each other (e.g., TDD enables refactoring)\n",
    "   - Sustainable pace prevents burnout and quality degradation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scaling Agile**:\n",
    "   - **Nexus**: 3-9 teams, single product, integration focus\n",
    "   - **LeSS**: Minimal scaling, whole product focus, empirical process\n",
    "   - **SAFe**: Enterprise scale, comprehensive but heavyweight\n",
    "   - **Spotify Model**: Autonomous squads, chapter/tribe/guild structure\n",
    "   - Start with single-team Scrum, add scaling only when necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Automation and Tooling**:\n",
    "   - Generate Gantt charts from code (Mermaid.js) for version control\n",
    "   - Validate sprint readiness with automated checklists\n",
    "   - Integrate scheduling with CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "   - Use probabilistic methods (Monte Carlo) for uncertain software estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Agile Scheduling Mindset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Responding to change over following a plan**: Plans are valuable, but must adapt\n",
    "- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**: Roadmaps show direction, not fixed commitments\n",
    "- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**: Gantt charts document, but working code delivers\n",
    "- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**: Tools support, but people deliver\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Review Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Your team is doing \"Scrum\" but the Daily Scrum takes 45 minutes and turns into a problem-solving session.** What is the anti-pattern? How would you fix it as Scrum Master?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare and contrast WIP limits in Kanban with Sprint commitments in Scrum.** When would high WIP be acceptable? When would you violate a WIP limit?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Your organization wants to \"go Agile\" and is considering SAFe for a 2000-person IT department.** What are the risks? What alternatives would you suggest trying first?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explain why TDD (Test-Driven Development) enables refactoring.** How does the Red-Green-Refactor cycle support \"courage\" as an XP value?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Draw (using text or Mermaid) a CPM network diagram** for a project with:\n",
    "   - Task A (Design): 5 days\n",
    "   - Task B (Backend): 3 days (depends on A)\n",
    "   - Task C (Frontend): 4 days (depends on A)\n",
    "   - Task D (Integration): 2 days (depends on B and C)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Identify the critical path and float.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Your Kanban board has 8 items in \"Code Review\" but only 2 in \"In Dev.\"** What does this tell you? What actions would you take?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Practical Exercise: Design Your Agile Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**: You're starting a new project with a team of 6 developers, 1 designer, 1 QA engineer, and 1 Product Owner. The project is a B2B SaaS platform with a 6-month runway to MVP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**:\n",
    "- Requirements are evolving based on customer feedback\n",
    "- Technical complexity is medium-high (integrations with external APIs)\n",
    "- Team is co-located but may go remote\n",
    "- Investors want monthly demos\n",
    "- Compliance requirements (SOC 2) must be considered\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose and justify** your primary framework (Scrum, Kanban, or hybrid). Consider:\n",
    "   - Sprint length (if any)\n",
    "   - Ceremonies and their timeboxes\n",
    "   - Roles and responsibilities\n",
    "   - Metrics you'll track\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Design your WBS** for the 6-month period:\n",
    "   - Epics/Major components\n",
    "   - How you'll handle the \"fuzzy\" future work\n",
    "   - Definition of Ready and Definition of Done\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a visualization strategy**:\n",
    "   - What the team sees daily (Kanban board design)\n",
    "   - What management sees weekly (burn-down/up chart)\n",
    "   - What investors see monthly (roadmap view)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Technical Practices**:\n",
    "   - Which XP practices will you adopt?\n",
    "   - How will you handle technical debt?\n",
    "   - CI/CD pipeline requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scaling Considerations**:\n",
    "   - If successful, you'll need to grow to 3 teams. How does your current setup prepare for that?\n",
    "   - What decisions now will make scaling easier/harder?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverable**: A 10-minute presentation of your \"Agile Operating System\" including:\n",
    "- Visual board design (draw it or use Mermaid)\n",
    "- Ceremony schedule (calendar invite template)\n",
    "- Metrics dashboard mockup\n",
    "- Risk mitigation for your chosen approach\n",
