    "# Chapter 20: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening Context\n",
    "\n",
    "As software systems grow in complexity, the gap between the business domain (how experts think about the problem) and the technical implementation (how developers model it) often widens. This disconnect leads to software that is difficult to maintain, hard to evolve, and misaligned with business needs. **Domain\u2011Driven Design (DDD)**, popularized by Eric Evans, provides a set of patterns and principles to bridge that gap. It places the **domain**\u2014the core business logic\u2014at the center of the design, creating a shared language and model that both domain experts and developers can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores three foundational building blocks of DDD:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Entities vs. Value Objects** \u2013 How to distinguish objects that have identity from those that are defined solely by their attributes.\n",
    "2. **Aggregates and Repositories** \u2013 How to group related objects into consistency boundaries and provide persistence abstractions.\n",
    "3. **Bounded Contexts** \u2013 How to divide large domains into smaller, cohesive models with explicit boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns help you create a rich, expressive domain model that can evolve with the business while maintaining technical integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.1 Entities vs. Value Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent\n",
    "*Distinguish between objects that have a continuous identity (Entities) and objects that are defined by their attributes (Value Objects), and model them accordingly.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In object\u2011oriented design, we often create classes that represent real\u2011world concepts. However, not all objects are equal. Some have a lifecycle and identity that must be tracked (e.g., a customer, an order), while others are merely descriptive and interchangeable (e.g., a monetary amount, an address). Treating them the same way leads to confusion, unnecessary complexity, and subtle bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a `Person` class with attributes like name, birth date, and address. If two people have the same name and address, are they the same person? No, because each person has a unique identity. On the other hand, if two `Money` objects both represent $10 USD, they are considered equal regardless of any \u201cidentity\u201d \u2013 they are interchangeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Entities and Value Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "DDD defines two fundamental types of objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entities** \u2013 Objects that have a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. Equality is based on the identity, not the attributes.\n",
    "- **Value Objects** \u2013 Objects that are defined only by their attributes. They are immutable and interchangeable. Two value objects with the same attribute values are considered equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entities\n",
    "\n",
    "Entities are the backbone of the domain model. They have a lifecycle, can change over time, and are tracked by an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// domain/entities/customer.ts\n",
    "export class Customer {\n",
    "  constructor(\n",
    "    public readonly id: CustomerId, // unique identifier\n",
    "    private _name: string,\n",
    "    private _email: string,\n",
    "    private _loyaltyPoints: number = 0\n",
    "  ) {}\n",
    "\n",
    "  // Business methods\n",
    "  changeName(newName: string): void {\n",
    "    if (newName.length < 2) throw new Error('Name too short');\n",
    "    this._name = newName;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  addLoyaltyPoints(points: number): void {\n",
    "    this._loyaltyPoints += points;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  // Equality based on identity\n",
    "  equals(other: Customer): boolean {\n",
    "    return this.id.equals(other.id);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Value object for CustomerId (itself a value object)\n",
    "export class CustomerId {\n",
    "  constructor(private readonly value: string) {\n",
    "    if (!value) throw new Error('CustomerId cannot be empty');\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  equals(other: CustomerId): boolean {\n",
    "    return this.value === other.value;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  toString(): string {\n",
    "    return this.value;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- `Customer` has an identity (`CustomerId`). Even if two customers have the same name and email, they are different because their IDs differ.\n",
    "- The `equals` method compares IDs, not attributes.\n",
    "- `CustomerId` is a value object because it has no identity apart from its string value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Value Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Value objects are immutable and have no identity. They are often used to represent descriptive aspects of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// domain/value-objects/address.ts\n",
    "export class Address {\n",
    "  constructor(\n",

    "    public readonly postalCode: string,\n",
    "    public readonly country: string\n",
    "  ) {\n",

    "  }\n",

    "  // Equality based on all attributes\n",
    "  equals(other: Address): boolean {\n",
    "    return this.street === other.street &&\n",
    "           this.city === other.city &&\n",
    "           this.postalCode === other.postalCode &&\n",
    "           this.country === other.country;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Another example: Money\n",
    "export class Money {\n",
    "  constructor(\n",
    "    public readonly amount: number,\n",
    "    public readonly currency: string\n",
    "  ) {\n",
    "    if (amount < 0) throw new Error('Amount cannot be negative');\n",
    "    if (currency.length !== 3) throw new Error('Invalid currency code');\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  add(other: Money): Money {\n",
    "    if (this.currency !== other.currency) {\n",
    "      throw new Error('Cannot add different currencies');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return new Money(this.amount + other.amount, this.currency);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  equals(other: Money): boolean {\n",
    "    return this.amount === other.amount && this.currency === other.currency;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- `Address` and `Money` are immutable. Once created, their state cannot change.\n",
    "- To \"modify\" a value object, you create a new instance (e.g., `withStreet`).\n",
    "- Equality is based on all attributes; two addresses with the same values are considered equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clarity** \u2013 Distinguishing entities from value objects makes the domain model more expressive.\n",
    "- **Immutability** \u2013 Value objects are immutable, which eliminates side\u2011effects and makes them safe to share.\n",
    "- **Persistence optimisation** \u2013 Value objects can be embedded in entities (e.g., an address stored as columns in a customer table) without separate identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Over\u2011modelling** \u2013 Not every concept needs to be a value object; use judgment.\n",
    "- **Performance** \u2013 Creating many immutable objects can be expensive, but modern runtimes handle this well.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 20.2 Aggregates and Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent\n",
    "*Define consistency boundaries around groups of related objects (Aggregates) and provide a way to retrieve and persist them (Repositories).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In a rich domain model, objects reference each other. Without boundaries, it\u2019s easy to create a tangled web of relationships that is hard to maintain and reason about. Changes to one object might need to be consistent with changes to others, but enforcing consistency across many objects can be expensive and lead to contention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Aggregates\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Aggregate** is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. It has a root (the **Aggregate Root**) and a boundary. External objects can only hold references to the root, not to internal objects. All invariants (consistency rules) are enforced within the aggregate boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aggregate Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Aggregate Root is the only object that external clients can reference.\n",
    "- Internal objects (entities, value objects) can reference each other freely, but not outside the aggregate.\n",
    "- All changes to the aggregate must go through the root.\n",
    "- For consistency, within a single transaction, only one aggregate should be modified. (This is a guideline; in practice, eventual consistency may be used across aggregates.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Order Aggregate\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an order with line items. The order is the aggregate root; line items are internal entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// domain/aggregates/order.ts (Aggregate Root)\n",
    "import { OrderId } from '../value-objects/order-id';\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- `Order` is the aggregate root. Clients interact with the order to add/remove items, mark as paid, etc.\n",
    "- `OrderItem` is an internal entity (it has no identity outside the order). Its identity is local to the aggregate (e.g., productId + orderId).\n",
    "- The `Order` enforces invariants: cannot add items after payment.\n",
    "- External code cannot get a reference to an `OrderItem` directly; all operations go through the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repositories\n",
    "\n",

    "### Aggregate Design Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size** \u2013 Aggregates should be as small as possible while maintaining invariants. Large aggregates cause contention.\n",
    "- **References** \u2013 Reference other aggregates by identity only (e.g., `customerId`), not by object reference. This allows aggregates to be loaded independently.\n",
    "- **Transactional boundaries** \u2013 Modify only one aggregate per transaction. For operations spanning multiple aggregates, use eventual consistency (e.g., sagas).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency** \u2013 Invariants are enforced within the aggregate.\n",
    "- **Performance** \u2013 Smaller aggregates reduce contention.\n",
    "- **Clarity** \u2013 Explicit boundaries make the model easier to understand.\n",

    "### Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Over\u2011aggregation** \u2013 Making aggregates too large leads to performance issues.\n",
    "- **Under\u2011aggregation** \u2013 Too many tiny aggregates can make it hard to enforce consistency.\n",

    "## 20.3 Bounded Contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent\n",
    "*Explicitly define the boundaries within which a particular domain model applies, allowing multiple models to coexist without conflict.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Large organizations have multiple teams working on different parts of the system. The same term (e.g., \u201ccustomer\u201d) may mean different things in different contexts. For example, in the Sales context, a customer has a credit limit and sales history; in the Support context, the same customer has tickets and contact preferences. Trying to build a single, unified \u201cCustomer\u201d model that satisfies both contexts leads to a bloated, inconsistent model that is hard to maintain and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Bounded Contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Bounded Context** is a semantic boundary within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable. It aligns with team boundaries, subdomains, and language. Within a bounded context, the model is internally consistent, but terms may have different meanings in other contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategic Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Map** \u2013 A diagram or document that shows the relationships between bounded contexts.\n",
    "- **Integration patterns** \u2013 How contexts communicate:\n",
    "  - **Shared Kernel** \u2013 Share a subset of the model (rare).\n",
    "  - **Customer/Supplier** \u2013 One context provides data to another.\n",
    "  - **Conformist** \u2013 One context conforms to another\u2019s model.\n",
    "  - **Anti\u2011Corruption Layer (ACL)** \u2013 A translation layer that protects a context from the \u201ccorruption\u201d of another\u2019s model.\n",
    "  - **Open Host Service** \u2013 A protocol that gives access to the context as a service.\n",
    "  - **Published Language** \u2013 A shared, documented language (e.g., XML schema, JSON schema) for integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: E\u2011commerce System with Multiple Bounded Contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an e\u2011commerce platform with at least three bounded contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sales Context** \u2013 Handles orders, pricing, promotions.\n",
    "2. **Inventory Context** \u2013 Manages stock levels, warehouses.\n",
    "3. **Shipping Context** \u2013 Handles shipments, tracking.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integration**:\n",
    "When an order is placed in the Sales context, it needs to reserve stock in Inventory. This is done via an **Anti\u2011Corruption Layer** in the Inventory context that translates the Sales event into Inventory commands.\n",
    "\n",

    "// inventory/anti-corruption/sales-order.listener.ts\n",

    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The Inventory context does not depend on the Sales domain model. It receives a message in a neutral format (e.g., JSON) and translates it into its own domain commands.\n",
    "- This protects Inventory from changes in the Sales model.\n",

    "- **Integration complexity** \u2013 Communication between contexts requires careful design (ACLs, messages).\n",
    "- **Data duplication** \u2013 Data is often duplicated across contexts (e.g., product name). This is acceptable if eventual consistency is managed.\n",
    "- **Discoverability** \u2013 It can be hard for developers to understand the overall system without a context map.\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain\u2011Driven Design provides a set of patterns for building software that reflects complex business domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Entities vs. Value Objects** \u2013 Entities have identity and a lifecycle; value objects are immutable and defined by their attributes. Distinguishing them clarifies the model and promotes immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Aggregates and Repositories** \u2013 Aggregates define consistency boundaries with a root that controls access. Repositories provide a collection\u2011like interface for retrieving and persisting aggregates, isolating the domain from persistence concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bounded Contexts** \u2013 Explicit boundaries where a particular model applies. Contexts integrate via translation layers (e.g., Anti\u2011Corruption Layer), allowing multiple models to coexist without conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: DDD is not about technology; it\u2019s about creating a shared understanding of the domain and encoding that understanding into a software model. The tactical patterns (entities, value objects, aggregates) give you the building blocks, while the strategic patterns (bounded contexts) help you scale across large organizations.\n",

    "**Chapter 21: Common Anti-Patterns (Spaghetti Code, God Object, Golden Hammer, Premature Optimization)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns are powerful, but knowing when *not* to use them is equally important. Chapter 21 explores common anti\u2011patterns\u2014bad practices that seem like good ideas at first but lead to unmaintainable code. You\u2019ll learn to recognise and avoid them, and you\u2019ll be better equipped to write clean, sustainable software.\n",
