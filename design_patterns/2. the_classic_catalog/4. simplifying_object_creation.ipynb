    "# **Chapter 4: Simplifying Object Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Opening Context**\n",
    "Object creation is the most common source of coupling in software systems. When a class instantiates another class using the `new` operator, it creates a concrete dependency that violates the Dependency Inversion Principle. Creational patterns abstract the instantiation process, allowing systems to remain independent of how their objects are created, composed, and represented. This chapter examines the Factory Method and Abstract Factory patterns\u2014two approaches to decoupling creation from usage, satisfying both the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) established in Chapter 2.\n",

    "## **4.1 Factory Method: Defining an Interface for Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Intent**\n",
    "*Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Problem**\n",
    "Consider a logistics application that initially only handles transportation by truck. The `Logistics` class directly instantiates `Truck` objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// \u274c Direct instantiation violates DIP\n",
    "class Logistics {\n",
    "    planDelivery(): void {\n",
    "        const truck = new Truck(); // Concrete dependency!\n",
    "        truck.deliver();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the business requires sea logistics, we must modify `Logistics` to instantiate `Ship` objects, violating OCP. Worse, if we need air logistics later, we modify the class again. The creator class is tightly coupled to specific product classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Solution: Factory Method Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory Method pattern introduces an abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Product Interface**: Declares the interface of objects the factory method creates.\n",
    "2.  **Concrete Products**: Implement the Product interface.\n",
    "3.  **Creator (Abstract Class)**: Declares the factory method returning a Product object.\n",
    "4.  **Concrete Creators**: Override the factory method to return Concrete Product instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "/**\n",

    "\n",
    "- **OCP Compliance**: Adding `AirLogistics` required creating new classes, not modifying `Logistics`, `RoadLogistics`, or `SeaLogistics`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use Factory Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Factory Method when:\n",
    "1.  A class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.\n",
    "2.  A class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.\n",
    "3.  Classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Connection to Dependency Injection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern frameworks (Angular, Spring, ASP.NET Core) use Factory Method concepts but prefer **Constructor Injection**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// Modern approach: Dependency Injection (externalized factory)\n",
    "class ModernLogistics {\n",
    "    constructor(private transport: Transport) {} // Injected, not created\n",
    "    \n",
    "    planDelivery(): void {\n",
    "        this.transport.deliver();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Factory becomes external (often framework-managed)\n",
    "class TransportFactory {\n",
    "    static create(type: 'road' | 'sea'): Transport {\n",
    "        switch(type) {\n",
    "            case 'road': return new Truck();\n",
    "            case 'sea': return new Ship();\n",
    "            default: throw new Error(\"Unknown transport\");\n",

    "\n",
    "// Composition root (where concrete choices are made)\n",
    "const transport = TransportFactory.create('road');\n",
    "const logistics = new ModernLogistics(transport); // DIP satisfied\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### **The Problem**\n",
    "Consider a cross-platform UI toolkit. You need to create buttons, checkboxes, and text fields that share a common look-and-feel (Windows style vs. Mac style). Using Factory Method for each widget type leads to inconsistent mixing:\n",

    "In this chapter, we explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Factory Method**: Delegates instantiation to subclasses via an abstract method. Best when a class cannot anticipate the type of objects it needs to create, or when subclasses should specify the objects. Satisfies OCP by allowing new product types via new subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects. Best when a system must work with multiple product families and must ensure product compatibility. Satisfies DIP by depending on abstract factory and product interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Modern Context**: While these patterns remain relevant, Dependency Injection frameworks often externalize the factory responsibility, using composition over inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Decision Framework**:\n",
    "- One product type, multiple variants \u2192 **Factory Method**\n",
    "- Multiple related products that must work together \u2192 **Abstract Factory**\n",
    "- Simple creation with no family constraints \u2192 **Simple Factory** (not a GoF pattern, but common utility)\n",

    "## **Next Chapter Preview**\n",
    "**Chapter 5: Managing Complexity and State (Builder, Prototype, Singleton)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Having covered family creation, we now examine patterns for handling object construction complexity and object lifecycle management. Chapter 5 introduces the **Builder** pattern for constructing complex objects step-by-step (essential for objects with many optional parameters), the **Prototype** pattern for cloning existing objects efficiently, and the **Singleton** pattern\u2014its benefits for global state management and its significant drawbacks for testability that make it controversial in modern development. We will explore why dependency injection has largely replaced Singleton in contemporary architectures.\n",
