    "\n",
    "## **Opening Context**\n",
    "Algorithms are the soul of software, yet they are also a primary source of rigidity. When business rules become hard-coded in conditional statements, when variations of a process require copy-paste inheritance, or when direct method calls create unbreakable coupling between sender and receiver, systems become fragile. Behavioral patterns address these challenges by shifting the focus from object composition to communication and responsibility distribution. This chapter examines three foundational patterns: Strategy for interchangeable algorithms, Template Method for algorithmic skeletons, and Command for encapsulating requests as first-class objects. Together, they form the toolkit for making behavior as flexible as structure.\n",

    "**Strategy Selection Strategies**:\n",
    "1.  **Constructor Injection**: Client chooses strategy at creation time.\n",

    "- **Concrete Command** (`LightOnCommand`, etc.): Binds specific receiver to specific action. Stores state necessary for undo (previous fan speed).\n",
    "- **Invoker** (`RemoteControl`): Holds commands and invokes them. Knows nothing about lights or fans\u2014only that it has commands that can be executed.\n",

    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "In this chapter, we established three fundamental Behavioral patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Strategy**: Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms. Enables runtime selection of behavior and eliminates conditional complexity. Satisfies OCP by allowing new algorithms without modifying contexts. **Status: Essential for algorithmic flexibility and plugin architectures.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Template Method**: Defines algorithm skeleton in base class, deferring variant steps to subclasses. Promotes code reuse through inheritance while enforcing algorithm structure. **Status: Ideal for frameworks and workflows with fixed sequences but variable implementations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects, decoupling sender from receiver. Enables queuing, logging, undo, and macro operations. Transforms method calls into data that can be manipulated. **Status: Critical for undo systems, job queues, and transactional architectures.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Distinctions**:\n",
    "- **Strategy** varies the entire algorithm via composition.\n",
    "- **Template Method** varies parts of the algorithm via inheritance.\n",
    "- **Command** turns actions into objects, enabling manipulation of requests (queue, log, undo).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Next Chapter Preview**\n",
    "**Chapter 9: Communication and Coordination (Observer, Mediator, Chain of Responsibility, Iterator)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with Behavioral patterns, Chapter 9 examines how objects communicate without tight coupling. We explore the **Observer** pattern for publish-subscribe notification systems (foundational to React, Redux, and event-driven architectures), the **Mediator** pattern for centralizing complex object interactions (reducing spaghetti dependencies), the **Chain of Responsibility** for passing requests through processing chains, and the **Iterator** pattern for traversing collections without exposing internal structure. These patterns address the critical challenge of managing interactions between objects that must remain loosely coupled."
