    "## **Opening Context**\n",
    "Inheritance is static\u2014defined at compile time, fixed for the object's lifetime. Yet modern applications require behavior that evolves dynamically: UI components that gain scrolling borders at runtime, file systems where folders contain other folders, shapes that render via different drawing APIs without code duplication, and games that render thousands of similar trees without exhausting memory. This chapter addresses four patterns that achieve flexibility through composition rather than inheritance. The Decorator enables runtime behavior stacking; Composite handles recursive tree structures; Bridge separates abstraction from implementation; and Flyweight enables massive-scale object sharing.\n",

    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "In this chapter, we explored four structural composition patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Decorator**: Wraps objects to add responsibilities dynamically. Uses recursive composition to stack behaviors. Alternative to subclassing when extensions are needed at runtime. **Status: Essential for I/O streams and UI enhancements.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Composite**: Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly through a common interface. Enables tree structures and part-whole hierarchies (file systems, UI trees). **Status: Fundamental for hierarchical data structures.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Bridge**: Decouples abstraction from implementation, allowing both to vary independently. Prevents Cartesian product class explosion. **Status: Critical for cross-platform and driver architectures.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Flyweight**: Shares intrinsic state among many objects to minimize memory usage. Separates shared and unique state. **Status: Specialized for large-scale object systems (games, text editors).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Distinctions**:\n",
    "- **Decorator** adds responsibilities to one object.\n",
    "- **Composite** aggregates many objects into tree structures.\n",
    "- **Bridge** separates abstraction from implementation hierarchies.\n",
    "- **Flyweight** shares objects to reduce memory.\n",

    "We transition from Structural to **Behavioral** patterns\u2014concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Chapter 8 begins with the **Strategy** pattern for interchangeable algorithms, the **Template Method** for algorithm skeletons with variant steps, and the **Command** pattern for encapsulating requests as objects (enabling undo, queuing, and macro recording). These patterns address the fundamental challenge of making algorithms flexible, reusable, and decoupled from the objects that use them.\n",
