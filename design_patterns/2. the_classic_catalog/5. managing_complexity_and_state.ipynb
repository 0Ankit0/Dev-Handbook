    "# **Chapter 5: Managing Complexity and State**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Opening Context**\n",
    "As objects grow in complexity—accumulating optional parameters, validation rules, and construction dependencies—constructor bloat becomes unmaintainable. Meanwhile, some objects are expensive to create from scratch, suggesting we copy existing instances rather than rebuild them. Finally, certain resources (database connections, configuration caches) legitimately require single instances, yet global state introduces testing nightmares and hidden coupling. This chapter addresses three distinct problems: telescoping constructors (Builder), expensive instantiation (Prototype), and instance control (Singleton). We will examine why modern industry practice celebrates the Builder, accepts the Prototype, and increasingly rejects the Singleton in favor of Dependency Injection.\n",

    "2.  **Invalid combinations**: Some parameters require others (e.g., `body` requires `method` to be POST/PUT), but the constructor cannot enforce this.\n",

    "- **Validation in Build**: Complex validation rules (e.g., body only with POST/PUT) are enforced in `build()`, not scattered across setters or the product class.\n",
    "- **Immutability**: The product is immutable (`readonly` fields), making it thread-safe and preventing invalid state changes after construction.\n",

    "### **The Problems: Why Singleton is Often an Anti-Pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its popularity, the Singleton pattern creates severe architectural issues recognized by modern industry standards:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Violation of Single Responsibility Principle**\n",
    "The class manages both its primary responsibility (database connection) *and* instance lifecycle management.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Hidden Dependencies (Action at a Distance)**\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "class OrderService {\n",
    "    processOrder(): void {\n",
    "        // Hidden dependency! No indication OrderService needs DatabaseConnection\n",
    "        const db = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();\n",
    "        db.query(\"INSERT INTO orders...\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Testing `OrderService` requires the global Singleton to exist, coupling all tests to database state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Testing Nightmares**\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// ❌ IMPOSSIBLE TO MOCK in unit tests\n",
    "test(\"processOrder creates record\", () => {\n",
    "    // Cannot inject mock database!\n",
    "    // Must use real database or complex global state reset\n",
    "    const service = new OrderService();\n",
    "    service.processOrder();\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Thread Safety Issues (Multi-threaded Environments)**\n",
    "In Java/C#, the basic implementation has race conditions during initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Race condition: Two threads could create two instances\n",
    "if (instance == null) { // Thread A and B both see null\n",
    "    instance = new DatabaseConnection(); // Both create instance!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thread-Safe Implementation (Double-Checked Locking)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "class ThreadSafeSingleton {\n",
    "    private static instance: ThreadSafeSingleton;\n",
    "    private static lock = new Object();\n",
    "\n",
    "    static getInstance(): ThreadSafeSingleton {\n",
    "        if (!ThreadSafeSingleton.instance) {\n",
    "            // Synchronized block\n",
    "            synchronized(ThreadSafeSingleton.lock, () => {\n",
    "                if (!ThreadSafeSingleton.instance) { // Double-check\n",
    "                    ThreadSafeSingleton.instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();\n",
    "                }\n",
    "            });\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        return ThreadSafeSingleton.instance;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Note: TypeScript doesn't have synchronized; this shows the conceptual pattern used in Java/C#.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Modern Alternative: Dependency Injection**\n",
    "\n",
    "The industry-standard replacement for Singleton is **Dependency Injection** combined with **Singleton Scope** (managed by framework):\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// ❌ OLD: Static Singleton\n",
    "class BadService {\n",
    "    db = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// ✅ MODERN: Injected dependency, singleton lifecycle managed by container\n",
    "interface Database {\n",
    "    query(sql: string): any[];\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class GoodService {\n",
    "    // Dependency is explicit in constructor\n",
    "    constructor(private db: Database) {}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    processOrder(): void {\n",
    "        this.db.query(\"INSERT...\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Framework (e.g., NestJS, Angular, Spring) manages singleton scope\n",
    "@Injectable({ scope: Scope.DEFAULT }) // Singleton scope\n",
    "class PostgresDB implements Database {\n",
    "    // Single instance created and shared by DI container\n",
    "    query(sql: string): any[] { /* ... */ }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Testability achieved via mocking\n",
    "test(\"processOrder creates record\", () => {\n",
    "    const mockDb: Database = {\n",
    "        query: jest.fn().mockReturnValue([])\n",
    "    };\n",
    "    const service = new GoodService(mockDb); // Inject mock\n",
    "    service.processOrder();\n",
    "    expect(mockDb.query).toHaveBeenCalled();\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of DI over Singleton**:\n",
    "- **Explicit dependencies**: Constructor shows requirements.\n",
    "- **Testability**: Easy to inject mocks/fakes.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Can switch between single and multiple instances via configuration, not code change.\n",
    "- **No global state**: Instance lifecycle managed by container, not static variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Legitimate Uses of Singleton**\n",
    "Despite drawbacks, Singleton remains appropriate for:\n",
    "1.  **True System Resources**: Logging services (though often wrapped), configuration caches, thread pools.\n",
    "2.  **Hardware Interfaces**: Printer spoolers, file system wrappers where OS enforces single access point.\n",
    "3.  **Stateless Utilities**: Math libraries, string manipulation (though static methods are often better).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of Thumb**: If you need Singleton for \"convenience\" or \"global access,\" use DI instead. If you need it because the hardware/OS enforces singularity, Singleton is justified.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "In this chapter, we examined three patterns handling construction complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Builder**: Essential for objects with many optional parameters. Enforces immutability, enables readable construction via fluent interfaces, and centralizes validation. The Director variant encapsulates construction algorithms. **Status: Industry standard, highly recommended.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Prototype**: Enables object creation via cloning, useful when initialization is expensive or when creating variations of templates. Requires careful distinction between shallow and deep copying. **Status: Specialized use, largely replaced by native cloning in modern languages but valuable for registry patterns.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Singleton**: Ensures single instance and global access but violates SRP, creates hidden coupling, and complicates testing. Modern practice replaces it with Dependency Injection using singleton scope. **Status: Considered anti-pattern in application code; acceptable only for system-level resources.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Decision Framework**:\n",
    "- Many optional constructor parameters? → **Builder**\n",
    "- Copy existing complex object? → **Prototype** (or `structuredClone`)\n",
    "- Need global single instance? → **Dependency Injection with Singleton Scope** (avoid static Singleton)\n",

    "## **Next Chapter Preview**\n",
    "**Chapter 6: Adapters and Wrappers (Adapter, Facade, Proxy)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Having completed Creational patterns, we transition to **Structural** patterns—concerned with how classes and objects compose to form larger structures. Chapter 6 introduces the **Adapter** pattern for bridging incompatible interfaces (essential for integrating legacy systems and third-party APIs), the **Facade** pattern for simplifying complex subsystems behind a unified interface, and the **Proxy** pattern for controlling access to objects (enabling lazy loading, access control, and remote communication). These patterns address the inevitable architectural challenge: making independently developed components work together seamlessly.\n",
