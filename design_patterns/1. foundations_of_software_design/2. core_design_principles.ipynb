    "# **Chapter 2: Core Design Principles (The Pillars)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Opening Context**\n",
    "Design patterns are not applied in a vacuum. They exist to solve problems created by violating fundamental design principles. Before you can effectively wield a Factory or Strategy pattern, you must understand **why** rigidity and fragility occur in code. The SOLID principles—coined by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)—are the guardrails that keep object-oriented systems maintainable. Patterns are the tactical implementations; SOLID is the strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.1 SOLID Principles in Depth**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**\n",
    "SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles guide when to use patterns and warn when pattern abuse creates complexity.\n",

    "### **2.1.1 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n",
    "**Definition**: *A class should have only one reason to change.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Idea**: If a class handles multiple responsibilities (e.g., calculating prices AND formatting invoices AND sending emails), changes to any one responsibility force the class to change, increasing the risk of breaking unrelated functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Connection**: SRP drives the use of **Facade**, **Mediator**, and **Command** patterns to separate concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Code Example: Violating vs. Obeying SRP**\n",

    "7.  **Composition over Inheritance**: Prefer assembling behaviors over inheriting them.\n",
