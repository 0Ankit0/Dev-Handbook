    "# Chapter 21: Common Anti-Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems. However, not every recurring solution is good—some are traps that lead to unmaintainable, fragile, or inefficient code. These traps are known as **anti‑patterns**. They often arise from well‑intentioned but misguided attempts to solve a problem quickly, or from applying a pattern in the wrong context. Recognising anti‑patterns is as important as knowing design patterns; it helps you avoid common pitfalls and refactor towards cleaner designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores four notorious anti‑patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spaghetti Code and Ravioli Code** – Two extremes of unstructured code that are hard to follow and modify.\n",
    "2. **The God Object and Golden Hammer** – A class that does too much, and a tool that is applied everywhere regardless of suitability.\n",
    "3. **Premature Optimization** – The root of many performance‑related evils.\n",
    "4. **Copy‑Paste Programming** – The silent killer of maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these anti‑patterns will sharpen your design instincts and help you build systems that remain clean over time.\n",

    "### Intent (of the Anti‑Pattern)\n",
    "*Describe code that lacks structure, making it nearly impossible to understand, test, or maintain.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spaghetti Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Spaghetti code is characterised by a tangled, unstructured control flow. It often results from overuse of `goto` statements (in older languages), deeply nested conditionals, and long methods that do everything. The code “winds around” like a plate of spaghetti, making it impossible to trace execution paths.\n",

    "**Problems**:\n",
    "- **Deep nesting** – Multiple levels of `if/else` make it hard to follow.\n",
    "- **Mixed concerns** – Validation, business logic, persistence, and error handling are all intertwined.\n",
    "- **Poor readability** – The flow is linear but cluttered; you need to read the whole function to understand any part.\n",
    "- **Untestable** – Testing requires simulating many nested conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ravioli Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Ravioli code is the opposite extreme: the code is broken into too many tiny, loosely connected pieces. Each piece is simple, but the interactions are hard to follow because the logic is scattered across many small functions or classes. It’s like ravioli—each piece is neat, but the overall dish is disconnected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Ravioli Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// ❌ RAVIOLI CODE: Too many tiny functions, logic scattered\n",

    "  if (!(await checkInventory(items))) return error('Out of stock');\n",
    "  const order = createOrder(user, items, discountedTotal);\n",

    "function error(msg: string) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems**:\n",
    "- **Scattered logic** – The main flow is clear, but to understand what `applyDiscount` does, you have to jump to that function.\n",
    "- **Hidden dependencies** – Functions may implicitly depend on global state or other functions.\n",
    "- **Over‑abstraction** – Functions that are only used once and are trivial add indirection without benefit.\n",
    "- **Testing overhead** – You need to test many tiny functions, often with overlapping scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Balance: Structured Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Good code lies in the middle: it has clear, cohesive modules with well‑defined responsibilities, but not so many that the overall flow is lost. Methods are long enough to tell a story but short enough to fit in your head.\n",

    "\n",
    "### God Object\n",
    "\n",
    "A **God Object** (or God Class) is a class that knows too much or does too much. It becomes the central point of the system, with many responsibilities. It often accumulates over time as developers add functionality to an existing class instead of creating new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: God Object in an E‑commerce System\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// ❌ GOD OBJECT: Handles everything\n",
    "class OrderManager {\n",
    "  private db: Database;\n",
    "\n",
    "  constructor() {\n",
    "    this.db = new Database(); // direct dependency\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  createOrder(userData: any, items: any[]) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  calculateTax(order: any) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  applyDiscount(order: any, code: string) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  sendConfirmationEmail(order: any) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  updateInventory(items: any[]) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  generateInvoice(order: any) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  trackShipment(orderId: string) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  handleReturns(orderId: string) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  generateSalesReport(start: Date, end: Date) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  // ... 50 more methods\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems**:\n",
    "- **Low cohesion** – Methods are unrelated (e.g., sales report generation and email sending).\n",
    "- **High coupling** – Every other part of the system depends on this one class.\n",
    "- **Hard to test** – You need to instantiate the whole god object to test any single method.\n",
    "- **Difficult to maintain** – Changes ripple through unrelated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Decompose the god object into smaller, focused classes following the **Single Responsibility Principle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// ✅ DECOMPOSED: Separate concerns\n",
    "class OrderCreator { /* ... */ }\n",

    "### Golden Hammer\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Golden Hammer** anti‑pattern occurs when a developer has a favourite tool, technique, or pattern and applies it to every problem, regardless of suitability. “If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Overusing Singleton\n",
    "\n",
    "A developer loves the Singleton pattern and uses it for everything—configuration, logging, database connections, even for services that should be instantiated per request.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// ❌ GOLDEN HAMMER: Singleton for everything\n",
    "class ConfigManager {\n",
    "  private static instance: ConfigManager;\n",
    "  private constructor() {}\n",
    "  static getInstance() { /* ... */ }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Logger {\n",
    "  private static instance: Logger;\n",
    "  private constructor() {}\n",
    "  static getInstance() { /* ... */ }\n",

    "  private static instance: OrderService;\n",
    "  private constructor() {}\n",
    "  static getInstance() { /* ... */ }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems**:\n",
    "- Singletons introduce global state, making unit testing difficult.\n",
    "- They hide dependencies (a class that uses `UserService.getInstance()` has an invisible dependency).\n",
    "- They can cause contention in multi‑threaded environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better**: Use dependency injection and appropriate scoping (e.g., per‑request for services, singleton only where truly needed, like configuration).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Golden Hammer examples**:\n",
    "- Using microservices for a simple CRUD app because they are trendy.\n",
    "- Applying complex design patterns (e.g., Visitor) to a simple problem.\n",
    "- Using a relational database for document‑oriented data because you know SQL well.\n",
    "\n",

    "Donald Knuth famously said: *“Premature optimization is the root of all evil.”* Developers often try to write “efficient” code from the start, using complex data structures, caching, or low‑level tricks.

    "Copy‑paste programming is one of the most common anti‑patterns. A developer finds a piece of code that does something similar, copies it, and makes minor modifications. The result is multiple copies of essentially the same logic, each with slight variations. When a bug is found or a change is needed, you have to find and update every copy.\n",

    "Anti‑patterns are the dark side of design—they teach us what *not* to do. This chapter covered four common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spaghetti Code and Ravioli Code** – Two extremes of poor structure. Spaghetti lacks organisation; ravioli is over‑fragmented. Aim for balanced, cohesive modules with clear responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **God Object and Golden Hammer** – A class that does too much, and a favourite tool applied everywhere. Decompose large classes and choose patterns based on the problem, not habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Premature Optimization** – Optimising before understanding the real bottlenecks leads to complex, hard‑to‑maintain code. Write clear code first, measure, then optimise where needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Copy‑Paste Programming** – Duplication is the enemy of maintainability. Always extract shared logic into reusable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: Recognising anti‑patterns is the first step toward avoiding them. When you spot these smells in your code, you have an opportunity to refactor towards cleaner, more sustainable designs.\n",

    "**Chapter 22: Refactoring to Patterns (Code Smells as Drivers, Step‑by‑Step Refactoring, TDD with Patterns)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing patterns and anti‑patterns is valuable, but the real skill lies in transforming messy code into well‑structured code. Chapter 22 explores how to use **code smells** to identify opportunities for applying patterns, how to refactor step‑by‑step without breaking the system, and how **Test‑Driven Development (TDD)** can guide you toward pattern‑based solutions.\n",
