    "Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems. However, not every recurring solution is good\u2014some are traps that lead to unmaintainable, fragile, or inefficient code. These traps are known as **anti\u2011patterns**. They often arise from well\u2011intentioned but misguided attempts to solve a problem quickly, or from applying a pattern in the wrong context. Recognising anti\u2011patterns is as important as knowing design patterns; it helps you avoid common pitfalls and refactor towards cleaner designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores four notorious anti\u2011patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spaghetti Code and Ravioli Code** \u2013 Two extremes of unstructured code that are hard to follow and modify.\n",
    "2. **The God Object and Golden Hammer** \u2013 A class that does too much, and a tool that is applied everywhere regardless of suitability.\n",
    "3. **Premature Optimization** \u2013 The root of many performance\u2011related evils.\n",
    "4. **Copy\u2011Paste Programming** \u2013 The silent killer of maintainability.\n",

    "\n",
    "Spaghetti code is characterised by a tangled, unstructured control flow. It often results from overuse of `goto` statements (in older languages), deeply nested conditionals, and long methods that do everything. The code \u201cwinds around\u201d like a plate of spaghetti, making it impossible to trace execution paths.\n",

    "### Ravioli Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Ravioli code is the opposite extreme: the code is broken into too many tiny, loosely connected pieces.

    "function error(msg: string) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems**:\n",
    "- **Scattered logic** \u2013 The main flow is clear, but to understand what `applyDiscount` does, you have to jump to that function.\n",
    "- **Hidden dependencies** \u2013 Functions may implicitly depend on global state or other functions.\n",
    "- **Over\u2011abstraction** \u2013 Functions that are only used once and are trivial add indirection without benefit.\n",

    "\n",
    "### God Object\n",
    "\n",
    "A **God Object** (or God Class) is a class that knows too much or does too much. It becomes the central point of the system, with many responsibilities. It often accumulates over time as developers add functionality to an existing class instead of creating new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: God Object in an E\u2011commerce System\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// \u274c GOD OBJECT: Handles everything\n",
    "class OrderManager {\n",
    "  private db: Database;\n",
    "\n",
    "  constructor() {\n",
    "    this.db = new Database(); // direct dependency\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  createOrder(userData: any, items: any[]) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  calculateTax(order: any) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  applyDiscount(order: any, code: string) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  sendConfirmationEmail(order: any) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  updateInventory(items: any[]) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  generateInvoice(order: any) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  trackShipment(orderId: string) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  handleReturns(orderId: string) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  generateSalesReport(start: Date, end: Date) { /* ... */ }\n",
    "  // ... 50 more methods\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems**:\n",
    "- **Low cohesion** \u2013 Methods are unrelated (e.g., sales report generation and email sending).\n",
    "- **High coupling** \u2013 Every other part of the system depends on this one class.\n",
    "- **Hard to test** \u2013 You need to instantiate the whole god object to test any single method.\n",
    "- **Difficult to maintain** \u2013 Changes ripple through unrelated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Decompose the god object into smaller, focused classes following the **Single Responsibility Principle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// \u2705 DECOMPOSED: Separate concerns\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Golden Hammer** anti\u2011pattern occurs when a developer has a favourite tool, technique, or pattern and applies it to every problem, regardless of suitability. \u201cIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201d\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Overusing Singleton\n",
    "\n",
    "A developer loves the Singleton pattern and uses it for everything\u2014configuration, logging, database connections, even for services that should be instantiated per request.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// \u274c GOLDEN HAMMER: Singleton for everything\n",
    "class ConfigManager {\n",
    "  private static instance: ConfigManager;\n",
    "  private constructor() {}\n",
    "  static getInstance() { /* ... */ }\n",

    "  private static instance: OrderService;\n",
    "  private constructor() {}\n",
    "  static getInstance() { /* ... */ }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems**:\n",
    "- Singletons introduce global state, making unit testing difficult.\n",
    "- They hide dependencies (a class that uses `UserService.getInstance()` has an invisible dependency).\n",
    "- They can cause contention in multi\u2011threaded environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better**: Use dependency injection and appropriate scoping (e.g., per\u2011request for services, singleton only where truly needed, like configuration).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Golden Hammer examples**:\n",
    "- Using microservices for a simple CRUD app because they are trendy.\n",
    "- Applying complex design patterns (e.g., Visitor) to a simple problem.\n",
    "- Using a relational database for document\u2011oriented data because you know SQL well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Step back, analyse the problem, and choose the simplest solution that works. Be aware of biases and hype.\n",

    "\n",
    "Anti\u2011patterns are the dark side of design\u2014they teach us what *not* to do. This chapter covered four common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spaghetti Code and Ravioli Code** \u2013 Two extremes of poor structure. Spaghetti lacks organisation; ravioli is over\u2011fragmented. Aim for balanced, cohesive modules with clear responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **God Object and Golden Hammer** \u2013 A class that does too much, and a favourite tool applied everywhere. Decompose large classes and choose patterns based on the problem, not habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Premature Optimization** \u2013 Optimising before understanding the real bottlenecks leads to complex, hard\u2011to\u2011maintain code. Write clear code first, measure, then optimise where needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Copy\u2011Paste Programming** \u2013 Duplication is the enemy of maintainability. Always extract shared logic into reusable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: Recognising anti\u2011patterns is the first step toward avoiding them. When you spot these smells in your code, you have an opportunity to refactor towards cleaner, more sustainable designs.\n",

    "**Chapter 22: Refactoring to Patterns (Code Smells as Drivers, Step\u2011by\u2011Step Refactoring, TDD with Patterns)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing patterns and anti\u2011patterns is valuable, but the real skill lies in transforming messy code into well\u2011structured code. Chapter 22 explores how to use **code smells** to identify opportunities for applying patterns, how to refactor step\u2011by\u2011step without breaking the system, and how **Test\u2011Driven Development (TDD)** can guide you toward pattern\u2011based solutions.\n",
