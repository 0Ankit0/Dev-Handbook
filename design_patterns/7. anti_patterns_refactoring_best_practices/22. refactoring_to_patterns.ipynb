    "## Opening Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing design patterns is only half the battle. The real skill lies in recognising when existing code can be improved by applying a pattern and then safely transforming that code without changing its behaviour. This is the art of **refactoring to patterns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactoring is the process of improving the internal structure of code without altering its external behaviour. Patterns are not just design goals; they are destinations that can be reached through a series of small, behaviour\u2011preserving steps. When you encounter **code smells**\u2014symptoms of deeper problems\u2014patterns often provide the cure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores three interconnected aspects:\n",

    "3. **Test\u2011Driven Development (TDD) with Patterns** \u2013 Using tests to guide the emergence of patterns.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What Are Code Smells?\n",
    "\n",
    "Code smells are surface indicators that usually correspond to deeper problems in the code. They are not bugs\u2014they don\u2019t prevent the program from working\u2014but they make the code harder to understand, change, and extend. Recognising smells is the first step toward refactoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common code smells include:\n",
    "- **Duplicated Code** \u2013 The same expression or logic appears in multiple places.\n",
    "- **Long Method** \u2013 A method that is too long and tries to do too many things.\n",
    "- **Large Class** \u2013 A class with too many responsibilities (often a God Object).\n",
    "- **Long Parameter List** \u2013 A method with too many parameters, making it hard to use.\n",
    "- **Switch Statements / Complex Conditionals** \u2013 Frequent type\u2011checking or conditional logic that could be replaced by polymorphism.\n",
    "- **Feature Envy** \u2013 A method that seems more interested in another class\u2019s data than its own.\n",
    "- **Inappropriate Intimacy** \u2013 Classes that know too much about each other\u2019s internal details.\n",
    "- **Primitive Obsession** \u2013 Overuse of primitive types instead of small objects (e.g., using strings for phone numbers, money, etc.).\n",
    "- **Speculative Generality** \u2013 Code that is designed for future use cases that never materialise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping Smells to Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Each smell suggests a family of patterns that can address the underlying problem. Here is a quick reference:\n",

    "### Example: Long Method \u2192 Strategy Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a method that calculates shipping cost based on the shipping method. It is long and full of conditionals:\n",

    "// \u274c LONG METHOD with conditionals\n",
    "class Order {\n",
    "  // ... other properties\n",

    "      }\n",
    "    } else if (this.shippingMethod === 'overnight') {\n",
    "      cost = this.totalWeight * 3 + 20;\n",
    "      // no extra\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "      throw new Error('Unknown shipping method');\n",

    "    return cost;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smell**: The method has multiple responsibilities (logic for each shipping type) and will grow as new methods are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern to apply**: **Strategy**. Encapsulate each shipping algorithm in its own class, and let the `Order` delegate to the chosen strategy.\n",

    "**Result after refactoring** (shown in Section 22.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 22.2 Step\u2011by\u2011Step Refactoring Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactoring is most effective when done in small, safe steps. Each step should keep the code compiling and tests passing. The process often follows this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify a smell** and decide which pattern might help.\n",
    "2. **Ensure you have good test coverage** for the area you are about to change.\n",
    "3. **Introduce the pattern incrementally**, one small step at a time.\n",
    "4. **Run tests after every change** to verify behaviour is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through a concrete example: refactoring the shipping cost calculation to use the **Strategy** pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 0: Initial Code (with tests)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have tests for the shipping cost method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// test/order.test.ts\n",
    "describe('Order shipping cost', () => {\n",
    "  it('calculates standard shipping', () => {\n",
    "    const order = new Order({ totalWeight: 8, shippingMethod: 'standard' });\n",
    "    expect(order.calculateShippingCost()).toBe(8 * 0.5 + 5); // 9\n",
    "  });\n",
    "  // ... other tests\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create Strategy Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "First, define an interface that represents the shipping cost algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// shipping-strategy.ts\n",
    "export interface ShippingStrategy {\n",
    "  calculate(weight: number): number;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "No behaviour change yet; the `Order` still uses the old method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Extract Each Algorithm into a Concrete Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Create one class for each shipping method, implementing the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// strategies/standard-shipping.strategy.ts\n",
    "export class StandardShippingStrategy implements ShippingStrategy {\n",
    "  calculate(weight: number): number {\n",
    "    let cost = weight * 0.5 + 5;\n",
    "    if (weight > 10) {\n",
    "      cost += 10;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return cost;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// strategies/express-shipping.strategy.ts\n",
    "export class ExpressShippingStrategy implements ShippingStrategy {\n",
    "  calculate(weight: number): number {\n",
    "    let cost = weight * 1.5 + 10;\n",
    "    if (weight > 5) {\n",
    "      cost += 5;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return cost;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",

    "// strategies/overnight-shipping.strategy.ts\n",
    "export class OvernightShippingStrategy implements ShippingStrategy {\n",
    "  calculate(weight: number): number {\n",
    "    return weight * 3 + 20;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Modify Order to Use Strategy via Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a property to `Order` that holds the current strategy. For now, we'll set it in the constructor or via a setter, but we still keep the old method to avoid breaking existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// order.ts (partial)\n",
    "import { ShippingStrategy } from './shipping-strategy';\n",
    "\n",
    "export class Order {\n",
    "  private shippingStrategy: ShippingStrategy;\n",
    "\n",
    "  constructor(/* ... */, shippingMethod: string) {\n",
    "    // ... other initializations\n",
    "    this.setShippingStrategy(shippingMethod);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  setShippingStrategy(method: string): void {\n",
    "    switch (method) {\n",
    "      case 'standard':\n",
    "        this.shippingStrategy = new StandardShippingStrategy();\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "      case 'express':\n",
    "        this.shippingStrategy = new ExpressShippingStrategy();\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "      case 'overnight':\n",
    "        this.shippingStrategy = new OvernightShippingStrategy();\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "      default:\n",
    "        throw new Error('Unknown shipping method');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  // Old method still works\n",
    "  calculateShippingCost(): number {\n",
    "    return this.shippingStrategy.calculate(this.totalWeight);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check**: All tests should still pass because the behaviour is identical; we just delegated to the strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Remove the Switch Statement from Order\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that `Order` uses the strategy, we can remove the method string from the constructor and instead require the client to pass a strategy directly. This is a bigger change; we might do it in two substeps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, add a new constructor that accepts a `ShippingStrategy` and mark the old constructor as deprecated.\n",
    "- Then, update clients to pass the appropriate strategy.\n",
    "- Finally, remove the old constructor and the `setShippingStrategy` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// order.ts (final)\n",
    "export class Order {\n",
    "  constructor(\n",
    "    private totalWeight: number,\n",
    "    private shippingStrategy: ShippingStrategy\n",
    "  ) {}\n",
    "\n",
    "  calculateShippingCost(): number {\n",
    "    return this.shippingStrategy.calculate(this.totalWeight);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Client code now creates the strategy explicitly\n",
    "const order = new Order(8, new StandardShippingStrategy());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- `Order` no longer knows about shipping methods; it just delegates.\n",
    "- Adding a new shipping method requires creating a new strategy class, not modifying `Order`.\n",
    "- The shipping algorithms can be tested independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step\u2011by\u2011Step Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduced interface.\n",
    "2. Extracted algorithms into classes.\n",
    "3. Added strategy member and used it internally while keeping old method.\n",
    "4. Updated constructor to accept strategy and removed old conditional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step was small, and tests passed after each change. This is the essence of safe refactoring.\n",

    "---\n",

    "## 22.3 Test\u2011Driven Development (TDD) with Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### TDD Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Test\u2011Driven Development (TDD) is a technique where you write a failing test first, then write the simplest code to make it pass, and finally refactor to improve the design. Patterns often emerge naturally during the refactoring phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Evolving a Calculator into Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we need to evaluate simple arithmetic expressions like \"3 + 5\" and later \"2 * (3 + 4)\". We'll use TDD to guide us toward an **Interpreter** pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Start with the simplest test\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// test/calculator.test.ts\n",
    "describe('Calculator', () => {\n",
    "  it('evaluates a single number', () => {\n",
    "    const calc = new Calculator();\n",
    "    expect(calc.evaluate('3')).toBe(3);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation** (simplest):\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "class Calculator {\n",
    "  evaluate(expr: string): number {\n",
    "    return parseInt(expr, 10);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Add test for addition\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "it('adds two numbers', () => {\n",
    "  const calc = new Calculator();\n",
    "  expect(calc.evaluate('3+5')).toBe(8);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the simple implementation fails. We need to parse the expression. We could add a quick hack:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "evaluate(expr: string): number {\n",
    "  if (expr.includes('+')) {\n",
    "    const parts = expr.split('+');\n",
    "    return parseInt(parts[0]) + parseInt(parts[1]);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  return parseInt(expr);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Test passes. But the code is already getting messy. This is a smell (primitive obsession, long method).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Add test for subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "it('subtracts two numbers', () => {\n",
    "  expect(calc.evaluate('10-3')).toBe(7);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have to modify the method again, adding more conditionals. This is becoming unmaintainable. Time to refactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Refactor toward a pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that each operation (+, -) can be represented as an object. This suggests the **Command** or **Expression** pattern. Let's introduce an interface for expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "interface Expression {\n",
    "  interpret(): number;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create classes for numbers and operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "class NumberExpression implements Expression {\n",
    "  constructor(private value: number) {}\n",
    "  interpret(): number { return this.value; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class AddExpression implements Expression {\n",
    "  constructor(private left: Expression, private right: Expression) {}\n",
    "  interpret(): number { return this.left.interpret() + this.right.interpret(); }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class SubtractExpression implements Expression {\n",
    "  constructor(private left: Expression, private right: Expression) {}\n",
    "  interpret(): number { return this.left.interpret() - this.right.interpret(); }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need a parser that builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the string. For simplicity, we'll assume the expression is in postfix notation or we'll implement a simple recursive descent parser. This is extra work, but the pattern makes it extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "class Calculator {\n",
    "  evaluate(expr: string): number {\n",
    "    const ast = this.parse(expr);\n",
    "    return ast.interpret();\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  private parse(expr: string): Expression {\n",
    "    // For demonstration, assume we have a tokenizer and parser.\n",
    "    // This is simplified; a real parser would handle precedence.\n",
    "    // But the key is that we return an Expression tree.\n",
    "    // Example: \"3+5\" -> new AddExpression(new NumberExpression(3), new NumberExpression(5))\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: Adding multiplication now just requires a new `MultiplyExpression` class and a small update to the parser\u2014no changes to existing classes. The code follows the **Open/Closed Principle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Patterns Emerge from TDD\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we didn't start with the Interpreter pattern. We started with tests, wrote the simplest code, and when the code became messy, we refactored toward a pattern that solved the recurring problem of adding new operations. This is a common and powerful way to let design emerge organically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactoring to patterns is a disciplined way to improve code quality without introducing new bugs. This chapter covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Smells as Drivers** \u2013 Smells like long methods, duplicated code, and complex conditionals point to the need for specific patterns. Recognising these smells is the first step toward better design.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step\u2011by\u2011Step Refactoring Techniques** \u2013 Safe refactoring proceeds in tiny, behaviour\u2011preserving steps. By introducing interfaces, extracting classes, and gradually delegating, you can transform messy code into a pattern\u2011based solution while keeping tests green.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test\u2011Driven Development with Patterns** \u2013 TDD encourages simple code first, then refactoring. Patterns often emerge naturally during the refactoring phase, guided by the need to keep tests passing and code clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: Patterns are not destinations you design upfront; they are refactoring targets you reach incrementally. Combined with a solid test suite, this approach yields robust, maintainable code that can evolve with changing requirements.\n",
