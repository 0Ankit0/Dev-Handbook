    "# Chapter 17: Data Management in Distributed Systems (CQRS, Event Sourcing, Saga, Sharding)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In a monolithic application, data management is relatively straightforward: a single database handles all reads and writes, transactions ensure consistency, and queries are simple. However, when we decompose a system into microservices, each service often owns its own database. This **database\u2011per\u2011service** pattern brings new challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do we maintain consistency across services without distributed transactions?\n",
    "- How do we handle complex queries that span multiple services?\n",
    "- How do we scale data storage and access under high load?\n",
    "- How do we maintain an audit trail of changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter addresses these challenges with four powerful patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** \u2013 Separates the models for writing (commands) and reading (queries) to optimize each independently.\n",
    "2. **Event Sourcing** \u2013 Stores the state of an entity as a sequence of immutable events, enabling auditability, time travel, and rebuilding of state.\n",
    "3. **Saga Pattern** \u2013 Manages distributed transactions across multiple services using a sequence of local transactions and compensating actions.\n",
    "4. **Sharding and Partitioning** \u2013 Distributes data across multiple databases or nodes to achieve scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns are essential building blocks for modern, scalable, and resilient distributed systems. By the end of this chapter, you\u2019ll understand how to apply them to real\u2011world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 17.1 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent\n",
    "*Separate the operations that modify data (commands) from those that retrieve data (queries) into different models, allowing each to be optimized, scaled, and evolved independently.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) systems, a single model is used for both reads and writes. This works well for simple applications, but as complexity grows, several issues arise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impedance mismatch** \u2013 The object\u2011oriented domain model used for writes may not match the shape of data needed for complex read queries.\n",
    "- **Performance conflicts** \u2013 Write\u2011optimized storage (e.g., normalized relational tables) may be inefficient for complex read queries, requiring joins or denormalization that slow down writes.\n",
    "- **Scalability** \u2013 Reads often outnumber writes by orders of magnitude. Scaling both on the same model is inefficient; you might need to scale reads independently.\n",
    "- **Security** \u2013 Read and write operations may have different security requirements, which are harder to enforce in a unified model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: CQRS\n",
    "\n",
    "CQRS separates the **command side** (handling updates) from the **query side** (handling reads). Each side can have its own data store, optimized for its purpose. Commands use a domain model (often with complex business logic), while queries use a simplified read model (denormalized, possibly cached). The two models are kept eventually consistent, often through events.\n",

    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The command side uses a domain model with business logic and saves to a normalized write database.\n",
    "- The command handler publishes an event after successful write.\n",
    "- An event handler (separate component) updates the denormalized read model.\n",
    "- The query side reads directly from the read model, which is optimized for queries (e.g., pre\u2011joined, aggregated).\n",
    "- The read model is **eventually consistent** with the write side; there is a small delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use CQRS\n",
    "\n",
    "CQRS adds complexity, so it should be used when:\n",
    "- The application has significantly different read and write workloads (e.g., reads >> writes).\n",
    "- Complex queries are hard to perform on the write model.\n",
    "- You need to scale reads and writes independently.\n",
    "- Different teams will work on read and write sides (e.g., separate bounded contexts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability** \u2013 Read and write stores can be scaled independently.\n",
    "- **Optimized performance** \u2013 Each model is tuned for its purpose (e.g., denormalized reads, normalized writes).\n",
    "- **Security** \u2013 Can enforce different permissions for reads and writes.\n",
    "- **Flexibility** \u2013 You can use different databases for reads (e.g., Elasticsearch) and writes (e.g., PostgreSQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complexity** \u2013 More moving parts, eventual consistency, and potential for data staleness.\n",
    "- **Eventual consistency** \u2013 Some users may see outdated data; not suitable for all use cases.\n",
    "- **Higher development effort** \u2013 Requires building event propagation and synchronization.\n",

    "## 17.2 Event Sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent\n",
    "*Store the state of an entity as a sequence of state\u2011changing events. Instead of storing the current state, the system stores all events that have happened; the current state can be derived (replayed) from these events.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional persistence stores the current state of an entity, overwriting previous states. This has limitations:\n",
    "- **No audit trail** \u2013 You lose historical changes.\n",
    "- **No time travel** \u2013 You cannot easily see the state at a point in the past.\n",
    "- **Complex event\u2011driven integrations** \u2013 You often emit events manually, which may be lost if not persisted.\n",
    "- **Debugging difficulties** \u2013 When a bug occurs, you cannot replay the sequence of events that led to the faulty state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Event Sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "With Event Sourcing, every change to an entity is captured as an immutable event. The current state is obtained by replaying all events for that entity. The event store is the primary source of truth; the current state can be cached for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event** \u2013 An immutable record of something that happened (e.g., `OrderPlaced`, `OrderItemAdded`, `OrderCancelled`).\n",
    "- **Aggregate** \u2013 A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit (e.g., an `Order` aggregate). Events are applied to the aggregate to change its state.\n",
    "- **Event Store** \u2013 A database that stores events, typically append\u2011only. It also acts as a message queue for event subscribers.\n",
    "- **Projection** \u2013 A read model built by processing events. Projections are used for queries and can be stored in separate databases.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- Projections are event handlers that update denormalized read models.\n",
    "- They can be rebuilt by replaying all events from the beginning (if the projection logic changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Event Sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complete audit log** \u2013 Every change is recorded, providing a perfect audit trail.\n",
    "- **Time travel** \u2013 You can reconstruct the state at any point in time.\n",
    "- **Debugging and analysis** \u2013 Reproduce bugs by replaying events.\n",
    "- **Flexible projections** \u2013 Build any number of read models without impacting the write side.\n",
    "- **Event\u2011driven architecture** \u2013 Events can be published to other services naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complexity** \u2013 Learning curve, event versioning, and handling schema evolution.\n",
    "- **Storage** \u2013 Event stores can grow large; snapshots are often used to limit replay.\n",
    "- **Eventual consistency** \u2013 Read models are eventually consistent.\n",
    "- **Querying the event store** \u2013 Direct querying of events is limited; you rely on projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snapshotting\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid replaying all events from the beginning, you can periodically take a **snapshot** of the aggregate's state. When loading, you load the latest snapshot and then apply events after that snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",

    "## 17.3 Saga Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent\n",
    "*Manage distributed transactions across multiple services by using a sequence of local transactions, each with a compensating action that undoes it if subsequent steps fail.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In a distributed system, a single business operation often spans multiple services. For example, placing an order might involve:\n",
    "1. Order Service: create order (status = pending)\n",
    "2. Payment Service: reserve credit\n",
    "3. Inventory Service: reserve items\n",
    "4. Order Service: confirm order (status = confirmed)\n",
    "\n",
    "If any step fails, we need to undo the previous steps to maintain consistency. Traditional ACID transactions are not possible across different databases; we need a different approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Saga\n",
    "\n",
    "A **saga** is a sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates the database and publishes a message or event. If a local transaction fails, the saga executes **compensating transactions** that undo the changes made by the preceding local transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common coordination styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choreography** \u2013 Each service produces and listens to events, deciding when to act or compensate.\n",
    "- **Orchestration** \u2013 A central coordinator (saga orchestrator) tells each service what to do and handles compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Choreography\u2011Based Saga\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's model an order placement saga using events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Order Service creates order and publishes `OrderCreated`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// order-service/commands/place-order.ts\n",

    "  return order.id;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Payment Service listens, reserves credit, publishes `PaymentReserved` or `PaymentFailed`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// payment-service/events/order-created.handler.ts\n",
    "async function handleOrderCreated(event: any) {\n",
    "  try {\n",

    "  }\n",
    "}\n",

    "// inventory-service/events/payment-reserved.handler.ts\n",
    "async function handlePaymentReserved(event: any) {\n",
    "  try {\n",

    "  } catch (err) {\n",
    "    await publishEvent('InventoryFailed', { orderId: event.orderId, reason: err.message });\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Order Service listens for `InventoryReserved` and confirms order**\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// order-service/events/inventory-reserved.handler.ts\n",

    "  await publishEvent('OrderConfirmed', { orderId: event.orderId });\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compensation: If `PaymentFailed` occurs, Order Service cancels the order**\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// order-service/events/payment-failed.handler.ts\n",
    "async function handlePaymentFailed(event: any) {\n",
    "  await updateOrderStatus(event.orderId, 'CANCELLED');\n",
    "  // maybe also notify customer\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**If `InventoryFailed` occurs, Order Service cancels and Payment Service releases credit (by listening to `InventoryFailed`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// payment-service/events/inventory-failed.handler.ts\n",
    "async function handleInventoryFailed(event: any) {\n",
    "  await releaseCredit(event.orderId); // compensating action\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- Each service reacts to events and performs its local transaction.\n",
    "- If a step fails, an event is published that triggers compensating actions in previous services.\n",
    "- This is **choreography** \u2013 no central controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Orchestration\u2011Based Saga\n",

    "## 17.4 Sharding and Partitioning Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent\n",
    "*Distribute data across multiple databases or nodes to achieve scalability, performance, and high availability.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A single database has limits: storage capacity, connection limits, write throughput, and query performance. As data grows, these limits become bottlenecks. We need a way to split data across multiple physical databases while presenting a logical view to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sharding** (also called horizontal partitioning) splits data across multiple databases (shards) based on a **shard key**. Each shard holds a subset of the data. The application routes queries to the appropriate shard(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shard Key** \u2013 A field or combination of fields used to determine which shard holds a given record (e.g., `customer_id`, `order_id`).\n",
    "- **Sharding Strategy** \u2013 How the shard key maps to a shard (e.g., range\u2011based, hash\u2011based, directory\u2011based).\n",
    "- **Cross\u2011Shard Queries** \u2013 Queries that need data from multiple shards are complex and often avoided; they require scatter\u2011gather.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sharding Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Range\u2011Based Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "Partition data by ranges of the shard key, e.g., customers with IDs 1\u20131000 in shard 1, 1001\u20132000 in shard 2, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Easy to implement.\n",
    "- Range queries on the shard key are efficient within a shard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- Hotspots if ranges are not balanced (e.g., new customers all go to the last shard).\n",
    "- Resharding (splitting a range) can be complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Hash\u2011Based Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute a hash of the shard key and mod by the number of shards: `shard = hash(key) % N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Even distribution of data.\n",
    "- Simple to route.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- Resharding (adding/removing shards) requires rehashing, often needing data migration.\n",
    "- Range queries across shards are inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Directory\u2011Based Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain a lookup table that maps each key to a shard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Flexible; you can move data easily.\n",
    "- Supports custom sharding logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- Lookup table can become a bottleneck or single point of failure.\n",
    "- Additional lookup overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing a Simple Sharded Repository\n",

    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The `ShardManager` routes queries based on the shard key (here `customerId`).\n",

    "### Partitioning (Within a Database)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partitioning** is similar to sharding but occurs within a single database instance (e.g., PostgreSQL table partitioning). It splits a table into smaller physical pieces while keeping a logical view.\n",

    "### Trade\u2011offs and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shard Key Selection** \u2013 Critical for performance. Must evenly distribute data and support common query patterns.\n",

    "- **Resharding** \u2013 Plan for growth. Consistent hashing can help minimize data movement.\n",
    "- **Joins** \u2013 Avoid joins across shards; denormalize or use application\u2011level joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sharding in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Many databases offer built\u2011in sharding (e.g., MongoDB sharding, Cassandra partitioning). In relational databases, you often implement sharding at the application level or use middleware (e.g., Vitess for MySQL, Citus for PostgreSQL).\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explored four essential patterns for managing data in distributed systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CQRS** separates write and read models, allowing each to be optimised and scaled independently. It introduces eventual consistency but provides flexibility for complex queries and high\u2011performance reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Event Sourcing** stores state as a sequence of immutable events. It enables auditability, time travel, and flexible projections, but adds complexity and requires careful versioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Saga** manages distributed transactions across services using local transactions and compensating actions. It can be choreographed via events or orchestrated by a central coordinator.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sharding** partitions data across multiple databases to achieve scalability. Choosing the right shard key and strategy is critical, and cross\u2011shard queries must be handled carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: In distributed systems, we trade strong consistency and simplicity for scalability and resilience. These patterns provide the tools to make that trade\u2011off successfully.\n",
