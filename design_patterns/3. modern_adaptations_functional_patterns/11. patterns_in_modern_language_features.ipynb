    "# **Chapter 11: Patterns in Modern Language Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Opening Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Software development is not static. Languages evolve, absorbing idioms and patterns that were once manually crafted. The classic Design Patterns catalog from 1994 addressed shortcomings of languages like C++ and Smalltalk. Today\u2019s languages\u2014C#, Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript\u2014have integrated many of those concepts as first\u2011class language features. What once required a dozen lines of boilerplate can now be expressed with a single keyword or a lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores three major ways modern language features have transformed how we implement patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependency Injection (DI)** has become the preferred way to manage object creation and lifetimes, effectively replacing the Singleton and Factory patterns in many contexts.\n",
    "2. **Lambdas and Higher\u2011Order Functions** allow us to replace several behavioral patterns (Strategy, Command, Template Method, Observer) with concise, inline behavior.\n",
    "3. **Lazy Initialization** is now often provided by the language or its standard library, eliminating the need to hand\u2011roll thread\u2011safe lazy loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these evolutions helps you write cleaner, more expressive code that leverages the full power of your language, while still recognising when the classic pattern is the right tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **11.1 Dependency Injection (DI) as the \"New\" Singleton/Factory**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Problem with Classic Creational Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before modern DI containers, developers frequently used the **Singleton** pattern to ensure a single instance of a class, and the **Factory** pattern to encapsulate object creation. Both have significant drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Singleton** introduces global state, making unit testing difficult (you cannot easily replace the instance with a mock) and hiding dependencies (any method can call `Singleton.getInstance()`).\n",
    "- **Factory** often leads to factories for every aggregate root, creating boilerplate and still coupling the client to the factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple `OrderService` that needs a `PaymentGateway` and an `InventoryService`. A classic Singleton approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// \u274c SINGLETON: Hidden dependencies, global state\n",
    "class PaymentGateway {\n",
    "  private static instance: PaymentGateway;\n",
    "  private constructor() {}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  static getInstance(): PaymentGateway {\n",
    "    if (!PaymentGateway.instance) {\n",
    "      PaymentGateway.instance = new PaymentGateway();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return PaymentGateway.instance;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  \n",
    "  charge(amount: number): void { /* ... */ }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class InventoryService {\n",
    "  private static instance: InventoryService;\n",
    "  private constructor() {}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  static getInstance(): InventoryService {\n",
    "    if (!InventoryService.instance) {\n",
    "      InventoryService.instance = new InventoryService();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return InventoryService.instance;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  \n",
    "  reserve(productId: string, quantity: number): boolean { /* ... */ }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class OrderService {\n",
    "  processOrder(order: Order): void {\n",
    "    // Hidden dependencies: Who created these? When are they initialized?\n",
    "    PaymentGateway.getInstance().charge(order.total);\n",
    "    InventoryService.getInstance().reserve(order.productId, order.quantity);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems**:\n",
    "- `OrderService` now has hidden dependencies on `PaymentGateway` and `InventoryService`.\n",
    "- Unit testing `OrderService` is impossible without also initialising those singletons.\n",
    "- The singleton constructors are private, so you cannot easily substitute mocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Solution: Dependency Injection**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependency Injection** is a pattern where an object receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. This implements the **Dependency Inversion Principle** (DIP): high\u2011level modules should not depend on low\u2011level modules; both should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three common forms of DI:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constructor Injection** (most common) \u2013 dependencies are provided through the class constructor.\n",
    "2. **Property/Setter Injection** \u2013 dependencies are assigned to public properties after construction.\n",
    "3. **Method Injection** \u2013 dependencies are passed as arguments to specific methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's refactor the example using constructor injection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// \u2705 DEPENDENCY INJECTION: Dependencies are explicit\n",
    "interface IPaymentGateway {\n",
    "  charge(amount: number): void;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "interface IInventoryService {\n",
    "  reserve(productId: string, quantity: number): boolean;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class PaymentGateway implements IPaymentGateway {\n",
    "  charge(amount: number): void {\n",
    "    console.log(`Charging $${amount}`);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class InventoryService implements IInventoryService {\n",
    "  reserve(productId: string, quantity: number): boolean {\n",
    "    console.log(`Reserving ${quantity} of ${productId}`);\n",
    "    return true;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class OrderService {\n",
    "  // Dependencies are injected via constructor\n",
    "  constructor(\n",
    "    private paymentGateway: IPaymentGateway,\n",
    "    private inventory: IInventoryService\n",
    "  ) {}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  processOrder(order: Order): void {\n",
    "    this.paymentGateway.charge(order.total);\n",
    "    this.inventory.reserve(order.productId, order.quantity);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Manual wiring (often called \"poor man's DI\")\n",
    "const paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway();\n",
    "const inventory = new InventoryService();\n",
    "const orderService = new OrderService(paymentGateway, inventory);\n",
    "orderService.processOrder(order);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- **Explicit dependencies** \u2013 the constructor signature tells you exactly what the class needs.\n",
    "- **Testability** \u2013 you can pass mock implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// Unit test with mocks\n",
    "const mockPayment = { charge: jest.fn() };\n",
    "const mockInventory = { reserve: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(true) };\n",
    "const service = new OrderService(mockPayment, mockInventory);\n",
    "service.processOrder(testOrder);\n",
    "expect(mockPayment.charge).toHaveBeenCalled();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility** \u2013 you can easily swap implementations (e.g., different payment gateways).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **From Manual DI to DI Containers**\n",
    "\n",
    "As applications grow, manually wiring dependencies becomes tedious. This is where **DI Containers** (also called IoC containers) come in. They automatically resolve and inject dependencies based on configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TypeScript, popular DI containers include **InversifyJS** and **TypeDI**. Here\u2019s an example using InversifyJS with decorators:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// Using InversifyJS DI Container\n",
    "import 'reflect-metadata';\n",
    "import { injectable, inject, Container } from 'inversify';\n",
    "\n",
    "const TYPES = {\n",
    "  PaymentGateway: Symbol.for('PaymentGateway'),\n",
    "  InventoryService: Symbol.for('InventoryService'),\n",
    "  OrderService: Symbol.for('OrderService')\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "@injectable()\n",
    "class PaymentGateway implements IPaymentGateway {\n",
    "  charge(amount: number): void { /* ... */ }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "@injectable()\n",
    "class InventoryService implements IInventoryService {\n",
    "  reserve(productId: string, quantity: number): boolean { /* ... */ }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "@injectable()\n",
    "class OrderService {\n",
    "  constructor(\n",
    "    @inject(TYPES.PaymentGateway) private paymentGateway: IPaymentGateway,\n",
    "    @inject(TYPES.InventoryService) private inventory: IInventoryService\n",
    "  ) {}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  processOrder(order: Order): void {\n",
    "    this.paymentGateway.charge(order.total);\n",
    "    this.inventory.reserve(order.productId, order.quantity);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Container configuration\n",
    "const container = new Container();\n",
    "container.bind<IPaymentGateway>(TYPES.PaymentGateway).to(PaymentGateway);\n",
    "container.bind<IInventoryService>(TYPES.InventoryService).to(InventoryService);\n",
    "container.bind<OrderService>(TYPES.OrderService).to(OrderService);\n",
    "\n",
    "// Resolve (the container automatically injects dependencies)\n",
    "const orderService = container.get<OrderService>(TYPES.OrderService);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How this replaces Singleton and Factory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Singleton replacement**: In the container, you can configure the **lifetime** of a dependency. For example, to mimic Singleton behaviour, you can use a **singleton scope**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "container.bind<IPaymentGateway>(TYPES.PaymentGateway)\n",
    "  .to(PaymentGateway)\n",
    "  .inSingletonScope(); // One instance shared across all consumers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now every class that needs `IPaymentGateway` receives the same instance, exactly like Singleton, but without the global state and hidden dependencies. The container manages the instance, and you can easily swap it for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factory replacement**: If you need to create objects with runtime parameters, you can inject a factory. Many DI containers provide auto\u2011generated factories:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// Using a factory in Inversify\n",
    "container.bind<interfaces.Factory<PaymentGateway>>(TYPES.PaymentGatewayFactory)\n",
    "  .toFactory<PaymentGateway>((context) => {\n",
    "    return () => {\n",
    "      return context.container.get(TYPES.PaymentGateway);\n",
    "    };\n",
    "  });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can simply inject the container itself (though this is often discouraged as it becomes a Service Locator). Better to use explicit factory interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **DI as a Pattern, Not a Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "It\u2019s important to note that Dependency Injection is first and foremost a **design pattern**, not a framework. You can practice DI without any container by manually wiring dependencies at the composition root (the entry point of your application). Frameworks like Spring (Java), ASP.NET Core (C#), and NestJS (Node.js) have built\u2011in DI containers that make it convenient, but the core idea remains the same: **dependencies are given to an object, not created by it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Insight**: DI, combined with a container, replaces the need for most custom Singleton and Factory implementations. The container becomes the single place that manages object creation and lifetimes, adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **11.2 Replacing Patterns with Lambdas and Higher\u2011Order Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern languages support **first\u2011class functions** (lambdas, closures, delegates) that can be passed around like data. This capability allows us to replace several classic behavioral patterns with much simpler constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strategy Pattern \u2192 Lambda Parameter**\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The standard implementation requires an interface and concrete classes.\n",

    "```typescript\n",
    "// Classic Strategy\n",
    "interface SortStrategy {\n",

    "**With Lambdas**:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the language supports first\u2011class functions, the `SortStrategy` interface becomes unnecessary. We can pass the sorting function directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// Functional approach: Strategy is just a function type\n",
    "type SortFunction = (data: number[]) => number[];\n",

    "const anotherSorter = new Sorter((data) => data.sort((a,b) => a - b));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works**: The strategy is just a piece of behavior. By representing it as a function, we eliminate the need for a hierarchy of strategy classes. This is especially powerful in languages with type inference and concise lambda syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Command Pattern \u2192 Function / Runnable**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization, queuing, and undoable operations. With lambdas, we can replace the command object with a function.\n",

    "### **Template Method Pattern \u2192 Higher\u2011Order Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. With higher\u2011order functions, we can pass the variable steps as arguments.\n",
    "\n",

    "While replacing patterns with lambdas reduces boilerplate, there are cases where the classic pattern is still preferable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complex behavior** that requires multiple methods (e.g., a Strategy that needs initialization and cleanup) might be better encapsulated in a class.\n",
    "- **Discoverability**: Named classes can be easier to find and document than anonymous lambdas.\n",
    "- **Framework integration**: Some frameworks expect classes (e.g., Angular\u2019s dependency injection works best with classes).\n",
    "- **Performance**: In some languages, creating many lambdas can have a higher overhead than reusing strategy objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to **use lambdas when the behavior is simple and the context is clear**, but don't force a functional style when a class would be more expressive.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **11.3 Lazy Loading and the Lazy Initialization Pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lazy loading** (or lazy initialization) is the tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed. This can improve startup performance and reduce memory usage.\n",

    "### **Language\u2011Integrated Lazy Loading**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern languages provide built\u2011in support for lazy initialization, handling thread safety and reducing boilerplate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C#: `Lazy<T>`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Service\n",

    "\n",
    "While Java has no built\u2011in `Lazy<T>`, libraries like Guava provide `Supplier` and `Suppliers.memoize()`. Modern Java can use `ConcurrentHashMap` for per\u2011key lazy loading.\n",

    "#### **Python: `property` with caching**\n",

    "### **Lazy Loading with Proxies (ES6)**\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript\u2019s `Proxy` can be used to create lazily\u2011initialized objects that intercept property access:\n",

    "function lazyProxy<T extends object>(factory: () => T): T {\n",
    "  let instance: T | null = null;\n",

    "      }\n",
    "      return instance[prop];\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  });\n",

    "const resource = lazyProxy(() => new ExpensiveResource());\n",
    "resource.doWork(); // first access triggers creation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach creates a transparent lazy object: the client code doesn\u2019t need to call `.value`; it just uses the object normally. However, it can have performance overhead and may not work with all features (e.g., `instanceof` checks).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases for Lazy Loading**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expensive resource initialization** \u2013 database connections, configuration parsing, large data structures.\n",
    "2. **Circular dependencies** \u2013 in DI scenarios, lazy loading can break circular references by delaying creation.\n",
    "3. **Conditional execution** \u2013 if a feature may never be used, loading it lazily saves resources.\n",
    "4. **Startup time optimization** \u2013 defer non\u2011essential work until after the application is responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Thread Safety Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "In multi\u2011threaded environments, lazy initialization must be thread\u2011safe to avoid creating multiple instances. Built\u2011in solutions like `Lazy<T>` in C# offer various thread\u2011safe modes. In Java, you might use `AtomicReference` or double\u2011checked locking with `volatile`. In languages without built\u2011in support, you can use locks or concurrent collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: Lazy loading can introduce subtle bugs if not implemented correctly, especially in concurrent scenarios. Prefer language\u2011provided or well\u2011tested library implementations when available.\n",

    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter examined how modern language features have evolved to incorporate or replace classic design patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependency Injection** has become the standard way to manage object creation and lifetimes. By inverting control, it makes dependencies explicit, improves testability, and\u2014when combined with a DI container\u2014can replace the need for hand\u2011crafted Singleton and Factory patterns. DI containers provide flexible lifetime management (singleton, scoped, transient) and auto\u2011wiring, centralizing object creation in a maintainable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lambdas and higher\u2011order functions** allow us to replace several behavioral patterns with concise, inline behavior:\n",
    "   - **Strategy** \u2192 function parameter\n",
    "   - **Command** \u2192 function/delegate\n",
    "   - **Template Method** \u2192 higher\u2011order function\n",
    "   - **Observer** \u2192 callback list\n",
    "   This shift reduces boilerplate and leverages the expressive power of modern languages. However, classic patterns still have their place when behavior is complex or when working within class\u2011centric frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lazy Initialization** is now often provided by language runtimes or standard libraries (`Lazy<T>` in C#, property caching in Python, or custom helpers in JavaScript). These built\u2011ins handle thread safety and reduce repetitive null\u2011check code, making lazy loading both safer and easier to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: The evolution of languages does not make design patterns obsolete\u2014it internalizes them. The patterns themselves remain valuable as conceptual tools; they simply manifest differently in code. Understanding both the classic form and the modern adaptation equips you to write code that is idiomatic, maintainable, and aligned with your language\u2019s strengths.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **Next Chapter Preview**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 12: Functional Programming Patterns (Monads, Functors, Immutability, Memoization, Currying)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will dive into the world of functional programming, exploring patterns that originate from category theory and have become mainstream in languages like Scala, F#, and even JavaScript. You will learn how **immutability** simplifies state management, how **functors** and **monads** (like `Option` and `Either`) provide elegant error handling, and how **memoization** and **currying** enable powerful code reuse and optimization. These patterns offer a different mindset for composing software, and they work hand\u2011in\u2011hand with the modern language features we\u2019ve just discussed."
