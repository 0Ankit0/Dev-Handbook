    "# Chapter 14: Web Basics and APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern software development increasingly revolves around web technologies. Whether building RESTful APIs, microservices, or web applications, understanding HTTP fundamentals and API architecture is essential. Python's ecosystem offers powerful tools for both consuming external APIs and building robust server-side applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter establishes the foundational concepts of web development: the HTTP protocol that governs all web communication, the architectural principles of REST APIs, and Python's `requests` library for consuming web services. These concepts provide the theoretical foundation before we explore specific frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django) in subsequent chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.1 HTTP Fundamentals: The Language of the Web\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is the application-layer protocol that powers the World Wide Web. Every web interaction\u2014loading a page, submitting a form, calling an API\u2014involves HTTP messages exchanged between clients and servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Request-Response Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP follows a request-response model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Client** sends an HTTP **Request** to a server\n",
    "2.  **Server** processes the request\n",
    "3.  **Server** sends an HTTP **Response** back to the client\n",

    "### HTTP Request Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTTP request consists of three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "POST /api/users HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: api.example.com\n",
    "Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"username\": \"alice\",\n",
    "    \"email\": \"alice@example.com\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Request Line:**\n",
    "*   **Method**: The action to perform (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, etc.)\n",
    "*   **Path (URI)**: The resource identifier (`/api/users`)\n",
    "*   **HTTP Version**: Protocol version (`HTTP/1.1` or `HTTP/2`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Headers:**\n",
    "Metadata about the request (key-value pairs):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Header | Purpose |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| `Host` | Target server domain |\n",
    "| `Content-Type` | Format of request body (`application/json`, `text/html`) |\n",
    "| `Authorization` | Authentication credentials |\n",
    "| `User-Agent` | Client identification |\n",
    "| `Accept` | Acceptable response formats |\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Body:**\n",
    "Data sent with the request (used with `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`). Empty for `GET` requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Methods (Verbs)\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP methods indicate the desired action on a resource:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from enum import Enum\n",
    "from typing import Dict\n",
    "\n",
    "class HTTPMethod(Enum):\n",
    "    \"\"\"HTTP methods and their semantics.\"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    GET = \"GET\"\n",
    "    # Retrieve resource. Safe, idempotent, cacheable.\n",
    "    # Should NOT modify server state.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    POST = \"POST\"\n",
    "    # Create new resource. NOT idempotent.\n",
    "    # Multiple identical requests create multiple resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    PUT = \"PUT\"\n",
    "    # Replace entire resource. Idempotent.\n",
    "    # Updates or creates resource at specific URI.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    PATCH = \"PATCH\"\n",
    "    # Partial update. NOT necessarily idempotent.\n",
    "    # Modifies specific fields of a resource.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    DELETE = \"DELETE\"\n",
    "    # Remove resource. Idempotent.\n",
    "    # Once deleted, subsequent deletes return same status.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    HEAD = \"HEAD\"\n",
    "    # Like GET but returns headers only. No body.\n",
    "    # Useful for checking resource existence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    OPTIONS = \"OPTIONS\"\n",
    "    # Returns allowed methods for resource.\n",
    "    # Used in CORS preflight requests.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idempotency Explained:**\n",
    "An operation is **idempotent** if making the same request multiple times produces the same result as a single request. `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` are idempotent; `POST` is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Idempotency matters for retry logic\n",
    "def safe_retry_example():\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Retrying idempotent operations is safe.\n",
    "    Retrying non-idempotent operations can cause duplicates.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    # GET: Safe to retry\n",
    "    # GET /users/123 \u2192 Returns user\n",
    "    # GET /users/123 again \u2192 Same result, no side effects\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # POST: NOT safe to retry without idempotency key\n",
    "    # POST /orders \u2192 Creates order #1\n",
    "    # POST /orders (retry) \u2192 Creates order #2 (DUPLICATE!)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # PUT: Safe to retry\n",
    "    # PUT /users/123 {\"email\": \"new@example.com\"}\n",
    "    # PUT /users/123 (retry) \u2192 Same update, same result\n",
    "    \n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Response Structure\n",
    "\n",

    "    return Response(user, status=201)  # CREATED\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statelessness\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is a **stateless protocol**: each request is independent, and the server doesn't retain context between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Stateless: Each request contains all necessary information\n",
    "# Request 1\n",
    "GET /api/profile HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Authorization: Bearer token123\n",
    "\n",
    "# Request 2 (Server doesn't remember Request 1)\n",
    "GET /api/orders HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Authorization: Bearer token123  # Must resend credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "# State is maintained via:\n",
    "# 1. Tokens (JWT, API keys) - sent with each request\n",
    "# 2. Cookies - server sends Set-Cookie, client returns Cookie\n",
    "# 3. URL parameters - session_id in query string (less secure)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.2 RESTful Architecture: Designing Web APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP's existing features (methods, status codes, URIs) to provide a uniform interface for resource manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### REST Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Resource-Based:**\n",
    "Everything is a **resource** identified by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Resources are nouns, not verbs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Good:   GET /users/123          (User is the resource)\n",
    "Bad:    GET /getUser?id=123     (Action in URL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Good:   POST /orders            (Order is the resource)\n",
    "Bad:    POST /createOrder       (Action in URL)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. HTTP Methods as Actions:**\n",
    "Use HTTP methods to indicate operations on resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# RESTful endpoint mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "# Collection: /users\n",
    "GET    /users           \u2192 List all users\n",
    "POST   /users           \u2192 Create new user\n",
    "\n",
    "# Item: /users/{id}\n",
    "GET    /users/123       \u2192 Get specific user\n",
    "PUT    /users/123       \u2192 Replace entire user\n",
    "PATCH  /users/123       \u2192 Update user partially\n",
    "DELETE /users/123       \u2192 Delete user\n",
    "\n",
    "# Nested resources\n",
    "GET    /users/123/orders           \u2192 List user's orders\n",
    "POST   /users/123/orders           \u2192 Create order for user\n",
    "GET    /users/123/orders/456       \u2192 Get specific order\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Representation:**\n",
    "Resources can have multiple representations (JSON, XML, HTML). Clients specify preference via `Accept` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Statelessness:**\n",
    "Each request contains all information needed to process it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State):**\n",
    "Responses include links to related actions, allowing clients to navigate the API dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"id\": 123,\n",
    "    \"username\": \"alice\",\n",
    "    \"email\": \"alice@example.com\",\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Web development fundamentals transcend specific frameworks and languages. You now understand **HTTP** as the protocol governing all web communication: the request-response cycle, methods that define operations, status codes that communicate outcomes, and headers that carry metadata. This knowledge enables you to debug network issues, optimize performance, and design robust APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RESTful architecture** provides a uniform, scalable approach to API design. By treating everything as resources identified by URIs and using HTTP methods semantically, REST APIs become intuitive, cacheable, and portable. You can design APIs that follow industry standards: clear resource hierarchies, consistent error responses, pagination strategies, and proper versioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **requests** library equips you to consume APIs with production-ready patterns: session management for connection pooling, comprehensive error handling for network resilience, authentication schemes from basic to OAuth, and retry strategies for transient failures. You understand that timeouts are mandatory and that idempotency determines whether operations can be safely retried.\n",
    "\n",
    "These foundations prepare you for framework-specific development. In the next chapter, we explore modern Python web frameworks\u2014FastAPI for high-performance APIs, Flask for microservices, and Django for full-stack applications\u2014building on the HTTP and REST concepts established here.\n",
    "\n",
