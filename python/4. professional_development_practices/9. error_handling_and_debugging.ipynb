    "# Chapter 9: Error Handling and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code that works under ideal conditions is straightforward; writing code that fails gracefully under unexpected conditions distinguishes professionals from amateurs. Error handling is not merely about preventing crashes—it is about maintaining system integrity, providing actionable feedback to users, and preserving diagnostic information for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores Python's exception mechanism, the art of designing meaningful error hierarchies, systematic debugging techniques, and the logging infrastructure that replaces `print()` statements in production environments. We will emphasize defensive programming patterns that align with modern industry standards, including exception groups, exception notes, and structured logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.1 Exceptions: The try-except-else-finally Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses **exceptions** to handle errors and exceptional conditions. When an error occurs, Python raises an exception. If unhandled, the program terminates with a traceback. The `try-except` construct allows you to intercept exceptions and respond appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete error handling block consists of four clauses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "def process_file(filename: str) -> Optional[str]:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Demonstrates the full exception handling syntax.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns file content or None if file cannot be processed.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    file_handle: Optional[object] = None\n",
    "    \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "        file_handle = open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8')\n",
    "        content: str = file_handle.read()\n",
    "        return content\n",
    "    \n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError as e:\n",
    "        # Handle specific exception type\n",
    "        print(f\"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.\")\n",
    "        print(f\"Details: {e}\")\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    \n",
    "    except PermissionError:\n",
    "        # Handle different specific exception\n",
    "        print(f\"Error: Permission denied when accessing '{filename}'.\")\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    \n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        # Catch-all (use sparingly and usually for logging before re-raising)\n",
    "        print(f\"Unexpected error: {e}\")\n",
    "        raise  # Re-raise the same exception\n",
    "    \n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Executes ONLY if try block succeeded (no exception raised)\n",
    "        print(\"File read successfully.\")\n",
    "        return content\n",
    "    \n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        # Always executes, regardless of success or failure\n",
    "        # Used for cleanup (closing files, releasing locks, etc.)\n",
    "        if file_handle:\n",
    "            file_handle.close()\n",
    "            print(\"File handle closed.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "result: Optional[str] = process_file(\"data.txt\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clause Execution Rules:**\n",
    "*   **`try`**: Mandatory. Contains the protected code.\n",
    "*   **`except`**: Optional (but useless without it). Catches specific exceptions. Can have multiple except blocks for different error types.\n",
    "*   **`else`**: Optional. Executes only if the `try` block completes without raising an exception. Useful for code that should run only on success, keeping the `try` block focused on the operation that might fail.\n",
    "*   **`finally`**: Optional. Always executes before leaving the `try` block (even if `return`, `break`, `continue`, or uncaught exceptions occur). Essential for resource cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exception Hierarchy and Specificity\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's built-in exceptions form a hierarchy. `Exception` is the base class for most user-facing exceptions, but you should catch the **most specific exception possible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Exception Hierarchy (Simplified):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "BaseException\n",
    " ├── SystemExit          (raised by sys.exit())\n",
    " ├── KeyboardInterrupt   (Ctrl+C)\n",
    " ├── GeneratorExit\n",
    " └── Exception           (base for user-defined exceptions)\n",
    "      ├── ArithmeticError\n",
    "      │    └── ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "      ├── LookupError\n",
    "      │    ├── IndexError\n",
    "      │    └── KeyError\n",
    "      ├── TypeError\n",
    "      ├── ValueError\n",
    "      └── OSError\n",
    "           ├── FileNotFoundError\n",
    "           ├── PermissionError\n",
    "           └── IsADirectoryError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry Standard:** Catch specific exceptions, never use bare `except:` (which catches `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`, preventing clean shutdowns).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# BAD PRACTICE - Never do this\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    risky_operation()\n",
    "except:  # Catches KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit, everything!\n",
    "    pass  # Silently swallows all errors\n",
    "\n",
    "# GOOD PRACTICE - Be specific\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    risky_operation()\n",
    "except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:  # Catch only expected errors\n",
    "    handle_error(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Exception Object\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use `except ExceptionType as e`, the variable `e` holds the exception instance containing valuable diagnostic information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def parse_port(config: dict) -> int:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Parse port number from configuration with detailed error handling.\"\"\"\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        port: int = int(config[\"port\"])\n",
    "        if not 1 <= port <= 65535:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(f\"Port {port} out of valid range\")\n",
    "        return port\n",
    "    except KeyError as e:\n",
    "        # e.args contains the arguments passed to the exception\n",
    "        missing_key: str = e.args[0]\n",
    "        raise ValueError(f\"Missing required configuration key: {missing_key}\") from e\n",
    "    except ValueError as e:\n",
    "        # str(e) gives the human-readable message\n",
    "        print(f\"Invalid port configuration: {e}\")\n",
    "        raise\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception Attributes:**\n",
    "*   `args`: Tuple of arguments passed to the constructor\n",
    "*   `__traceback__`: The traceback object associated with the exception\n",
    "*   `__cause__`: The original exception if using `raise ... from` (exception chaining)\n",
    "*   `__context__`: The exception being handled when this one was raised (implicit chaining)\n",
    "*   `__notes__` (Python 3.11+): List of additional notes added via `add_note()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exception Chaining and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "When you catch an exception and raise a different one, preserve the original context using the `from` keyword. This maintains the full error history.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def load_configuration(path: str) -> dict:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Load and parse configuration file.\"\"\"\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        with open(path, 'r') as f:\n",
    "            raw_data: str = f.read()\n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError as e:\n",
    "        # Explicit chaining - indicates direct causation\n",
    "        raise ConfigurationError(f\"Config file not found: {path}\") from e\n",
    "    \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        config: dict = json.loads(raw_data)\n",
    "    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n",
    "        # Also preserves context, but indicates conversion failure\n",
    "        raise ConfigurationError(f\"Invalid JSON in {path}\") from e\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return config\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output with chaining:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "ConfigurationError: Invalid JSON in config.json\n",
    "caused by JSONDecodeError: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 3 column 1 (char 45)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implicit vs. Explicit Chaining:**\n",
    "*   If you raise a new exception while handling another, Python automatically sets `__context__`\n",
    "*   Use `raise NewException() from original` to set `__cause__` explicitly when the new exception is a direct consequence of the original\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exception Groups (Python 3.11+)\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern Python supports **Exception Groups**, allowing multiple unrelated exceptions to be raised and caught together—particularly useful in concurrent programming (asyncio) or when validating multiple independent fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Raising multiple exceptions simultaneously\n",
    "def validate_user_data(data: dict) -> None:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Validate user data, collecting all errors.\"\"\"\n",
    "    errors: list[Exception] = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if \"email\" not in data:\n",
    "        errors.append(ValueError(\"Email is required\"))\n",
    "    if \"age\" in data and data[\"age\"] < 0:\n",
    "        errors.append(ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative\"))\n",
    "    if \"password\" in data and len(data[\"password\"]) < 8:\n",
    "        errors.append(ValueError(\"Password too short\"))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if errors:\n",
    "        # Raise all validation errors together\n",
    "        raise ExceptionGroup(\"Validation failed\", errors)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Handling exception groups\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    validate_user_data({\"age\": -5, \"password\": \"123\"})\n",
    "except ExceptionGroup as eg:\n",
    "    # Iterate through individual exceptions\n",
    "    for error in eg.exceptions:\n",
    "        print(f\"Validation error: {error}\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Or use except* for specific types\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        validate_user_data({\"age\": -5})\n",
    "    except* ValueError as eg:\n",
    "        print(f\"Caught {len(eg.exceptions)} ValueErrors\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Notes to Exceptions (Python 3.11+)\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhance exceptions with additional context using `add_note()`—invaluable for adding runtime context that wasn't available where the exception was originally raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def process_user_request(user_id: int, request_data: dict) -> None:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Process request with enriched error information.\"\"\"\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        user: User = fetch_user(user_id)\n",
    "    except UserNotFoundError as e:\n",
    "        # Add contextual information to help debugging\n",
    "        e.add_note(f\"Requested while processing action: {request_data.get('action')}\")\n",
    "        e.add_note(f\"Timestamp: {datetime.now().isoformat()}\")\n",
    "        e.add_note(f\"Request ID: {request_data.get('request_id')}\")\n",

    "\n",

    "When exceptions occur or logic fails, systematic debugging is essential. Python offers powerful debugging capabilities from simple print statements to sophisticated interactive debuggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Tracebacks\n",
    "\n",
    "A traceback is Python's stack trace—history of function calls that led to the error. Reading it correctly is fundamental:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"/app/main.py\", line 45, in <module>\n",

    "ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'null'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading the Traceback:**\n",
    "1.  **Bottom**: The actual exception and message (`ValueError`)\n",
    "2.  **Upwards**: The chain of calls, starting from the most recent\n",
    "3.  **Line numbers**: Exact locations in files\n",
    "4.  **Top**: The entry point (`<module>` means the script itself)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The error occurred in `db.py` line 55**, but the logical error might be that the database returned the string \"null\" instead of a number, indicating a schema or data quality issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Debugging with pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Debugger (`pdb`) allows you to pause execution, inspect variables, and step through code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "def complex_calculation(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n",
    "    result: int = x * 2\n",
    "    pdb.set_trace()  # Execution pauses here\n",
    "    # You now have an interactive prompt: (Pdb)\n",
    "    result += y\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python 3.7+ alternative: breakpoint()\n",
    "def modern_debug(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n",
    "    result: int = x * 2\n",

    "2.  **Rubber Ducking**: Explain the code line-by-line to an inanimate object (or colleague). Often you spot the error while explaining.\n",
    "3.  **Reproduce First**: Never debug without a reliable way to reproduce the error.\n",
    "4.  **Isolate Variables**: Comment out half the code. If error persists, it's in the remaining half.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logging for Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "While `print()` statements are tempting, they are often forgotten and pollute production output. Use the `logging` module instead (see 9.4), or temporary debug logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "def debug_function(data: dict) -> None:\n",
    "    logger.debug(f\"Function called with data: {data}\")\n",
    "    result: list = expensive_operation(data)\n",
    "    logger.debug(f\"Intermediate result: {result}\")\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.4 Logging: The Professional Alternative to print()\n",
    "\n",
    "Production applications cannot rely on `print()` for diagnostics. The `logging` module provides a flexible, configurable framework for recording events with severity levels, timestamps, and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Logging Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's logging system is hierarchical:\n",
    "1.  **Loggers**: Entry points—create one per module (`logging.getLogger(__name__)`)\n",
    "2.  **Handlers**: Send logs to destinations (console, file, network, email)\n",
    "3.  **Formatters**: Specify output layout\n",
    "4.  **Filters**: Fine-grained control over which logs pass through\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler, SysLogHandler\n",
    "from typing import override\n",

    "\n",
    "| Level | Numeric Value | When to Use |\n",
    "|-------|--------------|-------------|\n",
    "| `DEBUG` | 10 | Detailed diagnostic information during development |\n",
    "| `INFO` | 20 | Confirmation that things are working as expected |\n",
    "| `WARNING` | 30 | Indication that something unexpected happened, but software is still working |\n",

    "\n",
    "### Advanced Logging Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lazy Evaluation with Logging:**\n",
    "Logging functions accept format strings and arguments to avoid string formatting overhead when the message isn't emitted (e.g., debug logs in production):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# BAD - Always constructs the string, even if DEBUG is disabled\n",
    "logger.debug(f\"Processing {len(huge_list)} items: {huge_list}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# GOOD - Only formats if DEBUG is enabled\n",
    "logger.debug(\"Processing %d items: %s\", len(huge_list), huge_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "# MODERN (Python 3.6+) - Uses __format__ only if needed\n",
    "logger.debug(\"Processing %d items\", len(huge_list))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contextual Information with extra:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Add custom fields to log records\n",
    "logger.info(\n",
    "    \"User authentication successful\",\n",
    "    extra={\n",
    "        'user_id': user.id,\n",
    "        'ip_address': request.remote_addr,\n",
    "        'user_agent': request.user_agent\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Formatter must include these fields\n",
    "formatter = logging.Formatter(\n",
    "    '%(asctime)s - %(user_id)s - %(ip_address)s - %(message)s'\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured Logging (JSON):**\n",
    "For log aggregation systems (ELK, Splunk, Datadog), output JSON instead of text:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import json\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "class JSONFormatter(logging.Formatter):\n",
    "    @override\n",
    "    def format(self, record: logging.LogRecord) -> str:\n",
    "        log_obj: dict = {\n",
    "            'timestamp': self.formatTime(record),\n",
    "            'level': record.levelname,\n",
    "            'logger': record.name,\n",
    "            'message': record.getMessage(),\n",

    "            'line': record.lineno,\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        if hasattr(record, 'user_id'):\n",
    "            log_obj['user_id'] = record.user_id\n",
    "        return json.dumps(log_obj)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "json_handler: logging.StreamHandler = logging.StreamHandler()\n",
    "json_handler.setFormatter(JSONFormatter())\n",

    "| Scenario | Use Print? | Use Logging? | Reasoning |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|\n",
    "| Quick script, one-time run | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Simplicity |\n",
    "| Production application | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Configurability, levels, persistence |\n",
    "| Library code | ❌ Never | ✅ Yes | Let application control output |\n",

    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust error handling transforms fragile scripts into resilient applications. You have learned to use `try-except-else-finally` blocks with precise exception specificity, avoiding bare `except:` clauses that mask critical errors. You can design custom exception hierarchies that communicate domain-specific failures while preserving context through exception chaining (`raise ... from`). Modern Python features like Exception Groups and exception notes allow you to handle complex concurrent failures and enrich diagnostic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now possess systematic debugging techniques, from reading tracebacks effectively to using `pdb` for interactive inspection and leveraging IDE graphical debuggers. Finally, you understand that `logging` is not merely a better `print()`—it is a configurable, hierarchical infrastructure that separates diagnostic concerns from business logic, supports structured output for modern observability platforms, and allows runtime configuration of verbosity without code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, error handling and debugging are reactive measures. The next chapter shifts focus to proactive quality assurance—ensuring that errors are caught before they reach production through systematic testing strategies.\n",
