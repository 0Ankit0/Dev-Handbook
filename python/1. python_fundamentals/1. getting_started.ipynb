    "# Chapter 1: Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the beginning of your journey as a Python developer. This chapter is designed to ground you in the fundamentals of the Python ecosystem. Before we write a single line of logic, we must understand the tool we are using and set up a workspace that is efficient, safe, and professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern software landscape (2026 and beyond), setting up your environment correctly is just as important as writing the code itself. We will cover the history of Python, how to install it properly, how to manage different projects without causing conflicts, and how to execute your first instructions to the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Brief History\n",
    "Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was conceived as a successor to the ABC programming language, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the name \"Python\" was not derived from the snake, but from the British comedy series *Monty Python's Flying Circus*. Guido was a big fan, and this cultural influence is still seen today in Python's documentation and community (e.g., the term \"Spam\" is sometimes used in examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python Dominates in 2026\n",
    "You might wonder why Python has become the world's most popular programming language. The reasons are multi-faceted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Readability**: Python reads like English. Where other languages might use curly braces `{}` or semicolons `;` to define structure, Python uses whitespace. This forces developers to write clean, readable code.\n",
    "2.  **Versatility**: Python is a \"Swiss Army Knife.\" It is used in:\n",
    "    *   **Web Development** (Django, FastAPI, Flask)\n",
    "    *   **Data Science & AI** (Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch)\n",
    "    *   **Automation & Scripting** (Automating boring tasks)\n",
    "    *   **Embedded Systems** (Microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi)\n",
    "3.  **The Ecosystem**: Python Package Index (PyPI) hosts hundreds of thousands of third-party libraries. If you want to do something, chances are someone has already written a Python library for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Versions\n",
    "As of 2026, we are firmly in the Python 3 era. The transition from Python 2 to Python 3 was a major event that concluded in 2020. Today, **Python 3.14** is the latest stable release, offering improved performance, error messages, and typing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry Standard**: Always use the latest stable version of Python 3 (currently 3.14.x) for new projects unless legacy constraints force you otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Installation & Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To write Python code, you need the **Python Interpreter**. This is the program that reads your code and translates it into machine instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**On Windows:**\n",
    "1.  Go to the official [Python.org downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "2.  Download the installer for Python 3.14.\n",
    "3.  **Crucial Step**: When the installer opens, check the box that says **\"Add Python to PATH\"**.\n",
    "    *   *Why?* This allows you to run Python from any command prompt window without typing the full file path.\n",
    "4.  Click \"Install Now\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**On macOS:**\n",
    "The easiest way is using the Homebrew package manager (a standard industry tool).\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# If you don't have brew installed, visit brew.sh first\n",
    "brew install python\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternatively, you can download the macOS installer from Python.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**\n",
    "Python usually comes pre-installed, but it might be an older version. To install the latest Python 3:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Verification\n",
    "Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "# OR on some Linux systems\n",
    "python3 --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should see a response like `Python 3.14.3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Managing Python Versions (`pyenv`)\n",
    "In a professional environment, you might need different Python versions for different projects. While you can install multiple versions manually, the industry standard tool for managing this is **pyenv**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   *Note: This is optional for beginners but highly recommended for professional workflows.*\n",
    "*   `pyenv` allows you to switch global Python versions easily or set a specific version per project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Virtual Environments\n",
    "**This is the most important concept in this section.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are working on two projects:\n",
    "*   **Project A** needs `Django` version 4.2.\n",
    "*   **Project B** needs `Django` version 5.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you install these globally (onto your main system Python), they will conflict. One installation will overwrite the other, breaking one of your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution**: Virtual Environments.\n",
    "A virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Modern Way: `uv`\n",
    "In 2026, the industry has largely shifted towards tools that are faster and smarter than the traditional `pip`. The standard tool `venv` is built-in, but **`uv`** (written in Rust) is the modern recommendation for its speed (10-100x faster) and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a project with `uv`:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install uv first (one-time setup)\n",
    "pip install uv\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new project\n",
    "uv init my-hands-on-project\n",
    "cd my-hands-on-project\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Standard Way: `venv`\n",
    "If you prefer using the built-in tools (which is perfectly fine and requires no extra installation), here is how to set it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Create the environment:**\n",
    "Navigate to your project folder and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "*   `python -m venv`: Tells Python to run the `venv` module as a script.\n",
    "*   `.venv`: The name of the folder where the environment will live. The dot `.` makes it hidden on Unix systems, keeping your directory clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Activate the environment:**\n",
    "You must \"turn on\" the environment before working.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Windows (PowerShell)**:\n",
    "    ```powershell\n",
    "    .\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **Windows (Command Prompt)**:\n",
    "    ```cmd\n",
    "    .venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **macOS / Linux**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Verify Activation:**\n",
    "Once activated, you will usually see `(.venv)` at the start of your command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Your First Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the environment is set up, let's write some code. We will start with the classic \"Hello, World!\" program.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open your text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).\n",
    "2.  Create a new file named `main.py`.\n",
    "3.  Type the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "*   `print`: This is a built-in Python function. Its job is to output text to the console.\n",
    "*   `(...)`: Parentheses indicate that we are calling (executing) a function.\n",
    "*   `\"Hello, World!\"`: This is a **string**\u2014a sequence of characters. We use quotes to tell Python that this is text, not code.\n",
    "*   The result of this code is that the text `Hello, World!` appears on your screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Script\n",
    "To execute this file, go back to your terminal (ensure your virtual environment is active), navigate to the folder containing your file, and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python main.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: On some Linux systems, you might need to type `python3 main.py`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have just written and executed your first Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 The Python REPL\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we wrote code in a file and ran it all at once. This is called **Script Mode**. Python also has an interactive mode called **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "The REPL allows you to type code line-by-line and get instant feedback. It is incredible for testing snippets of code, doing quick math, or checking how a function works without creating a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting the REPL\n",
    "Simply type `python` (or `python3`) in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see a prompt change to `>>>`. This means Python is waiting for your input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the REPL\n",
    "Let's try some math and string manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 2 + 2\n",
    "4\n",
    ">>> \"Python\" + \" \" + \"Handbook\"\n",
    "'Python Handbook'\n",
    ">>> print(\"Instant feedback!\")\n",
    "Instant feedback!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modern REPL Features (Python 3.14+)\n",
    "If you are using Python 3.13 or 3.14, the REPL has received a massive upgrade (PEP 762). It now includes features that were previously only in third-party tools like IPython:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Colorful Output**: Errors and prompts are colored for better readability.\n",
    "2.  **Multiline Editing**: You can use the **Up Arrow** key to recall and edit multi-line blocks of code (like `if` statements or `for` loops), not just single lines.\n",
    "3.  **Better History**: Press **F2** to open a pager (like `less`) to browse your command history cleanly.\n",
    "4.  **Help**: Press **F1** to open the built-in help browser.\n",
    "5.  **Paste Mode**: Press **F3** to enter paste mode, which allows you to paste large blocks of code without them executing immediately or messing up indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exiting the REPL\n",
    "To leave the REPL and go back to your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> exit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "*In Python 3.13+, you can also just type `exit` without the parentheses.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we laid the groundwork for your future as a developer. We learned that Python is a powerful, readable language that dominates the industry due to its vast ecosystem. We installed the interpreter, learned the critical importance of **Virtual Environments** (using modern tools like `uv` or standard `venv`), and wrote our first script. Finally, we explored the **REPL**, a powerful tool for interactive coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a functioning laboratory. Your computer is ready to understand Python instructions. But instructions for what? In the next chapter, we will learn how to store information, categorize it, and perform basic operations on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Chapter**: Chapter 2: Variables, Data Types, and Basic Syntax."
