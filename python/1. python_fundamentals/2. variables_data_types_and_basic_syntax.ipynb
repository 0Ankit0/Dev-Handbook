    "# Chapter 2: Variables, Data Types, and Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your environment is ready and you have executed your first script, it is time to understand the fundamental building blocks of any program: **data** and **variables**. In Python, everything is an object, and understanding how Python handles data in memory is crucial for writing efficient, bug-free code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will teach you how to store information, manipulate it, and understand the underlying mechanics of Python's type system. We will follow modern industry standards, including type hinting and PEP 8 naming conventions, to ensure you develop professional habits from day one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Variables and Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "A **variable** in Python is not a box that holds data; rather, it is a **name** (or label) that points to an object in memory. This distinction is critical because it explains how Python handles assignment and modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you create a variable by assigning a value to a name using the equals sign `=`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating variables\n",
    "user_name: str = \"Alice\"\n",
    "age: int = 28\n",
    "pi_value: float = 3.14159\n",
    "is_active: bool = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "*   **Declaration and Assignment**: Python is dynamically typed. You do not need to declare the type beforehand (though we add type hints `: str`, `: int` for clarity and tooling—more on this later).\n",
    "*   **Naming Conventions (PEP 8)**: \n",
    "    *   Use `snake_case` for variable names (lowercase with underscores).\n",
    "    *   Names must start with a letter or underscore (`_`), never a number.\n",
    "    *   Names are case-sensitive (`User` and `user` are different variables).\n",
    "    *   Avoid single letters like `x` or `i` except in mathematical contexts or short loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Python Manages Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write `user_name = \"Alice\"`, Python performs three steps:\n",
    "1.  Creates a **string object** containing the value `\"Alice\"` in memory.\n",
    "2.  Creates the variable name `user_name` in the namespace.\n",
    "3.  **Binds** the name `user_name` to the object `\"Alice\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's visualize this with a more complex example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assignment creates a reference, not a copy\n",
    "original_list: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "new_reference = original_list  # Both point to the same object\n",
    "\n",
    "new_reference.append(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(original_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "print(new_reference)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: Both variables point to the same list object in memory. Modifying one modifies the other because they share the reference. This is a common source of bugs for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an actual copy, you would use:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "actual_copy = original_list.copy()  # or list(original_list) or original_list[:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Reassignment\n",
    "Variables are dynamic. You can rebind a name to a different type or value at any time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = \"Hello\"      # data points to a string object\n",
    "data = 42           # data now points to an integer object\n",
    "data = [1, 2, 3]    # data now points to a list object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python allows this, **industry best practice** is to keep variable types consistent within a scope to avoid confusion and bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Primitive Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in data types. The \"primitive\" or basic types form the foundation of all data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integers (`int`)\n",
    "Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals. Python integers have **unlimited precision** (they can be arbitrarily large, limited only by available memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Integers\n",
    "positive: int = 42\n",
    "negative: int = -17\n",
    "zero: int = 0\n",
    "large_number: int = 10**100  # 1 googol - Python handles this effortlessly\n",
    "\n",
    "# Underscores for readability (PEP 515)\n",
    "salary: int = 1_000_000  # Same as 1000000, easier to read\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)\n",
    "Floats represent real numbers with decimal points. They follow the IEEE 754 double-precision standard (64-bit), which means they have precision limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Floats\n",
    "temperature: float = 98.6\n",
    "negative_float: float = -273.15\n",
    "scientific: float = 3.5e5  # 3.5 × 10^5 = 350000.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Precision Warning\n",
    "result: float = 0.1 + 0.2\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 0.30000000000000004 (not exactly 0.3!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry Note**: Never use floats for precise financial calculations. Use the `decimal` module for money or use integers representing cents.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from decimal import Decimal, getcontext\n",
    "getcontext().prec = 6  # Set precision\n",
    "\n",
    "price: Decimal = Decimal('0.10')\n",
    "tax: Decimal = Decimal('0.20')\n",
    "total: Decimal = price + tax\n",
    "print(total)  # Output: 0.30 (exactly)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings (`str`)\n",
    "Strings are sequences of Unicode characters (text). In Python, strings are **immutable**, meaning once created, they cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# String definitions\n",
    "single_quotes: str = 'Hello'\n",
    "double_quotes: str = \"World\"  # Preferred when text contains apostrophes\n",
    "multiline: str = \"\"\"This is a\n",
    "multiline string that preserves\n",
    "formatting and line breaks.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unicode support\n",
    "emoji: str = \"Python 🐍\"\n",
    "chinese: str = \"你好世界\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Immutability demonstration\n",
    "name: str = \"Alice\"\n",
    "# name[0] = \"B\"  # This raises TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booleans (`bool`)\n",
    "Booleans represent truth values: `True` or `False`. They are a subtype of integers, where `True` equals `1` and `False` equals `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "is_logged_in: bool = True\n",
    "has_permission: bool = False\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boolean arithmetic (advanced but valid)\n",
    "print(True + True)  # Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### None Type (`NoneType`)\n",
    "`None` represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is not zero, not an empty string, and not False—it is nothingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_input: str | None = None  # Indicates variable exists but has no value yet\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_with_no_return() -> None:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "result = function_with_no_return()\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Types\n",
    "Use the `type()` function to inspect an object's type, and `isinstance()` for type checking (preferred in professional code):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "value: int = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "print(type(value))              # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "print(isinstance(value, int))   # Output: True\n",
    "print(isinstance(value, str))   # Output: False\n",
    "\n",
    "# Checking multiple types\n",
    "print(isinstance(value, (int, float)))  # Output: True (is it int OR float?)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Python categorizes them based on their function.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Strings are ubiquitous in programming. Mastering string manipulation is essential for data cleaning, parsing, and user interface development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "Strings are sequences, meaning they are ordered collections where each character has an index (position).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text: str = \"Python\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Indexing (0-based)\n",
    "first_char: str = text[0]   # 'P'\n",

    "reversed_text: str = text[::-1] # 'nohtyP' (negative step reverses)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Methods (Immutability in Action)\n",
    "Since strings are immutable, methods return new strings rather than modifying the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message: str = \"  Hello, World!  \"\n",

    "### Handling Conversion Errors\n",
    "Converting invalid strings raises `ValueError`. Always validate input in production code:\n",

    "    print(f\"Error: Cannot convert '{data}' to integer\")\n",
    "    value = 0  # Default value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit Conversion (Type Coercion)\n",
    "Python sometimes automatically converts types during operations, but it is conservative to avoid data loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Integer + Float = Float (widening conversion)\n",
    "result: float = 5 + 3.0  # 8.0 (int promoted to float)\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we built the vocabulary of Python. You learned that **variables** are references to objects in memory, not containers of data, which explains why reassignment and copying behave the way they do. We explored Python's **primitive data types**—integers, floats, strings, booleans, and None—and discussed their unique characteristics, such as the immutability of strings and the precision limits of floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now understand how to manipulate data using **operators**, from basic arithmetic to bitwise manipulation, and how to craft readable text using modern **f-string** formatting. Finally, you mastered **type conversion**, learning when Python converts types automatically and when you must intervene explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these fundamentals in place, you are ready to make your programs intelligent. In the next chapter, we will learn how to control the flow of execution—how to make decisions, repeat actions, and write code that responds dynamically to data.\n",
