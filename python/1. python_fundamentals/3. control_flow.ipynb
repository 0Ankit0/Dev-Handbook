    "# Chapter 3: Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "A program that simply executes instructions from top to bottom is limited. Real-world software must make decisions, repeat tasks, and handle different scenarios dynamically. **Control flow** refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will explore how to direct the execution path of your Python programs using conditional statements, pattern matching, loops, and comprehensions. By the end, you will understand not only the syntax but also the Pythonic philosophy of writing clean, readable control structures that adhere to modern industry standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Conditional Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements allow your program to execute certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `if` Statement\n",
    "The simplest form of conditional execution checks a single condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temperature: float = 22.5\n",
    "\n",
    "if temperature > 30.0:\n",
    "    print(\"It's hot outside. Stay hydrated.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Syntax Rules:**\n",
    "*   **Indentation**: Python uses indentation (typically 4 spaces, never tabs) to define code blocks. The indented code under the `if` statement is the \"body\" that executes only if the condition is `True`.\n",
    "*   **Colon**: Every control structure header (`if`, `elif`, `else`) must end with a colon `:`.\n",
    "*   **Consistency**: All lines in the same block must have identical indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `if-elif-else` Chain\n",
    "When you have multiple mutually exclusive conditions, use `elif` (else if) chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score: int = 85\n",
    "\n",
    "if score >= 90:\n",
    "    grade: str = \"A\"\n",
    "elif score >= 80:\n",
    "    grade: str = \"B\"\n",
    "elif score >= 70:\n",
    "    grade: str = \"C\"\n",
    "elif score >= 60:\n",
    "    grade: str = \"D\"\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    grade: str = \"F\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Grade: {grade}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution Flow**: Python evaluates conditions from top to bottom. As soon as one condition is `True`, its block executes and the entire chain is exited. Even if multiple conditions are true, only the first matching block runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truthiness and Boolean Contexts\n",
    "In Python, conditions don't need to explicitly compare to `True` or `False`. Values have inherent \"truthiness\":\n",
    "\n",
    "**Falsy Values** (evaluate to `False`):\n",
    "*   `None`\n",
    "*   `False`\n",
    "*   Zero: `0`, `0.0`, `0j`\n",
    "*   Empty sequences/collections: `\"\"`, `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `set()`, `range(0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Truthy Values**: Everything else is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_name: str = \"\"\n",
    "user_age: int = 0\n",
    "items_in_cart: list[str] = []\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pythonic checks (preferred over == \"\" or == 0 or == [])\n",
    "if not user_name:\n",
    "    print(\"Please enter your name\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if user_age:  # Only True if age is non-zero\n",
    "    print(f\"Age provided: {user_age}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if items_in_cart:\n",
    "    print(\"Proceeding to checkout\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Your cart is empty\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Chaining\n",
    "Python allows mathematical-style chained comparisons, which are more readable than logical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x: int = 15\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instead of: if x >= 10 and x <= 20:\n",
    "if 10 <= x <= 20:\n",
    "    print(\"x is between 10 and 20\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complex chaining\n",
    "y: int = 25\n",
    "if x < y < 100:\n",
    "    print(\"y is greater than x and less than 100\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ternary Conditional Expressions\n",
    "For simple if-else logic that fits on one line, use the ternary operator (conditional expression).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age: int = 20\n",
    "status: str = \"Adult\" if age >= 18 else \"Minor\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Equivalent to:\n",
    "# if age >= 18:\n",
    "#     status = \"Adult\"\n",
    "# else:\n",
    "#     status = \"Minor\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Can be used in function calls or f-strings\n",
    "print(f\"You are {'eligible' if age >= 18 else 'not eligible'} to vote.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry Guideline**: Use ternary expressions for simple value assignments only. If the logic is complex or spans multiple lines, use a standard `if-else` block for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `pass` Statement\n",
    "Sometimes you need a placeholder where code is syntactically required but you haven't written the logic yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def process_payment(amount: float) -> None:\n",
    "    pass  # TODO: Implement payment processing\n",
    "\n",
    "if user_is_admin:\n",
    "    pass  # Admins bypass this check for now\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3.2 Structural Pattern Matching (Python 3.10+)\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduced in Python 3.10 and enhanced in subsequent versions, **Structural Pattern Matching** (the `match` statement) provides a powerful way to extract information from complex data structures and dispatch based on data shape. It is inspired by similar features in functional languages like Haskell and Rust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Value Matching\n",
    "For simple cases, `match` resembles a switch statement, but it is more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "http_status: int = 404\n",
    "\n",
    "match http_status:\n",
    "    case 200:\n",
    "        print(\"Success\")\n",
    "    case 404:\n",
    "        print(\"Not Found\")\n",
    "    case 500:\n",
    "        print(\"Server Error\")\n",
    "    case _:\n",
    "        print(\"Unknown status\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# The underscore _ acts as a wildcard (default case)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matching Data Structures\n",
    "Pattern matching shines when deconstructing sequences and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "point: tuple[int, int] = (0, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "match point:\n",
    "    case (0, 0):\n",
    "        print(\"Origin\")\n",
    "    case (x, 0):  # Captures the x value into variable x\n",
    "        print(f\"On x-axis at {x}\")\n",
    "    case (0, y):  # Captures the y value\n",
    "        print(f\"On y-axis at {y}\")\n",
    "    case (x, y):  # Captures both\n",
    "        print(f\"Point at ({x}, {y})\")\n",
    "    case _:\n",
    "        print(\"Not a point\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matching Class Instances and Data Classes\n",
    "In modern Python development with type hints and data classes, pattern matching becomes invaluable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dataclasses import dataclass\n",
    "from typing import Union\n",
    "\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Circle:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use `match` vs `if-elif`:**\n",
    "*   Use `match` when **destructuring** data (extracting parts from tuples, lists, objects).\n",
    "*   Use `if-elif` for simple boolean conditions or ranges of numbers.\n",
    "*   `match` is often more readable when handling multiple types of data (enums, AST nodes, parsing).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops enable repetitive execution. Python provides two primary loop constructs: `for` (definite iteration) and `while` (indefinite iteration).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `for` Loop (Iteration)\n",
    "Unlike C-style languages where `for` loops iterate over indices, Python's `for` loop directly iterates over **iterables** (sequences or collections).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits: list[str] = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(f\"I like {fruit}\")\n",

    "# Output:\n",
    "# I like apple\n",
    "# I like banana\n",
    "# I like cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `range()` Function**\n",
    "When you need numerical iteration, use `range()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# range(stop) - starts at 0\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n",

    "Control flow transforms static scripts into dynamic applications. You have mastered **conditional logic**, using `if-elif-else` chains and the modern `match` statement for pattern matching to direct execution based on data. You learned to iterate efficiently using `for` and `while` loops, leveraging `enumerate()` and `zip()` to write clean, Pythonic code without C-style indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, you understand **comprehensions**\u2014the hallmark of experienced Python developers\u2014for creating collections declaratively and memory-efficiently with generator expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these tools, your programs can now process data flexibly. However, real-world data is rarely simple. To handle complex information\u2014like managing a collection of user records or a matrix of sensor data\u2014you need robust ways to organize and store data structures. In the next chapter, we will explore Python's powerful built-in collections that serve as the foundation for all data manipulation.\n",
