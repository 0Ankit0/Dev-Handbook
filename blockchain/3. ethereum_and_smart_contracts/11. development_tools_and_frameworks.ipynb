    "\n",
    "Building smart contracts is just the beginning. To develop robust, secure, and maintainable decentralized applications, you need a professional development environment. This chapter explores the most popular tools and frameworks used by blockchain developers, from Hardhat and Foundry to Remix and package managers. By the end, you'll know how to set up a complete development pipeline for testing, deploying, and managing smart contracts.\n",

    "## 11.1 Hardhat Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum software. It helps you compile, deploy, test, and debug your smart contracts. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for smart contract development \u2013 it handles everything from compilation to testing to deployment, with an extensible plugin system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.1.1 Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- Node.js (v16+)\n",
    "- npm or yarn\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create a new project directory\n",
    "mkdir my-hardhat-project\n",
    "cd my-hardhat-project\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize npm project\n",
    "npm init -y\n",

    "# Initialize Hardhat project\n",
    "npx hardhat init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "During initialization, you'll be prompted:\n",
    "```\n",
    "? What do you want to do? \n",
    "  Create a JavaScript project\n",
    "  Create a TypeScript project\n",
    "  Create an empty hardhat.config.js\n",
    "  Quit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose \"Create a JavaScript project\" (or TypeScript if preferred). It will create a sample project with a contract, tests, and deployment script.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Install additional recommended packages:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox\n",
    "npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/contracts\n",
    "npm install --save-dev dotenv\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Hardhat uses Mocha and Chai for testing. Tests are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript) and can be run with `npx hardhat test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example test (`test/Token.js`):**\n",

    "\n",
    "### 11.1.4 Deployment Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment scripts are JavaScript files that run on the Hardhat network. They use the `ethers` library to interact with the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example deployment script (`scripts/deploy.js`):**\n",

    "  const initialSupply = ethers.parseUnits(\"1000000\", 18);\n",
    "  const token = await MyToken.deploy(initialSupply);\n",
    "\n",
    "  await token.waitForDeployment();\n",
    "\n",
    "  console.log(\"MyToken deployed to:\", await token.getAddress());\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "main()\n",
    "  .then(() => process.exit(0))\n",
    "  .catch((error) => {\n",
    "    console.error(error);\n",
    "    process.exit(1);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deploy to a local network:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deploy to a testnet (e.g., Sepolia):**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.1.5 Hardhat Network and Forking\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardhat comes with a built-in local Ethereum network (Hardhat Network) that's perfect for testing. One of its most powerful features is **forking** \u2013 you can simulate the state of a live network (like Ethereum mainnet) locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forking mainnet in `hardhat.config.js`:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  networks: {\n",
    "    hardhat: {\n",
    "      forking: {\n",
    "        url: \"https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY\",\n",
    "        blockNumber: 15000000 // optional: specific block\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you run tests or scripts, you have access to all mainnet contracts and balances. This is invaluable for testing interactions with existing protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.1.6 Plugins and Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardhat's plugin system extends its functionality. The `hardhat-toolbox` includes several essential plugins:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify`: Verify contracts on Etherscan.\n",
    "- `hardhat-gas-reporter`: Estimate gas costs.\n",
    "- `solidity-coverage`: Measure test coverage.\n",
    "- `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers`: Enhanced Chai matchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing a custom plugin:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then require it in `hardhat.config.js`:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "require(\"@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Popular plugins:**\n",
    "- `hardhat-deploy`: Manage deployments with tags and migrations.\n",

    "## 11.2 Foundry Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundry is a fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. It's becoming increasingly popular because of its speed and the ability to write tests in Solidity directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.2.1 Installation (Forge, Cast, Anvil)\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundry consists of:\n",
    "- **Forge**: Compiles, tests, and deploys contracts.\n",
    "- **Cast**: A CLI for interacting with contracts (sending transactions, querying data).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 11.6.1 npm in Blockchain Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "npm is the default package manager for JavaScript-based projects (Hardhat, Truffle). It manages both JavaScript dependencies and Solidity contracts.\n",

    "**Installing a Solidity package:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install @openzeppelin/contracts\n",

    "```\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts\n",
