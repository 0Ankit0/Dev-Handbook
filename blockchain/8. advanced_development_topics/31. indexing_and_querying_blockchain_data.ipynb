    "# Chapter 31: Indexing and Querying Blockchain Data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart contracts emit events and store data, but retrieving that data efficiently is a challenge. Querying the blockchain directly\u2014scanning all blocks, filtering logs, and aggregating results\u2014is slow, expensive, and impractical for real-time applications. Indexing solutions solve this by extracting, processing, and serving blockchain data in a structured, queryable format. The Graph has emerged as the leading decentralized indexing protocol, enabling developers to build APIs (subgraphs) that are fast, reliable, and easy to query. In this chapter, we'll explore the need for indexing, dive deep into The Graph, and examine alternative solutions like Alchemy, Moralis, and QuickNode. You'll learn how to build and query subgraphs to power your DApps with efficient data access.\n",

    "## 31.1 Challenges of Blockchain Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 31.1.1 Data Retrieval Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Blockchains are designed for append-only, verifiable storage, not for efficient querying. Retrieving specific information often requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scanning entire blocks**: To find all transfers of a token, you'd need to iterate through every block from genesis to present\u2014millions of blocks.\n",
    "- **Parsing transaction receipts**: Extracting event logs from each block and filtering by contract address and event signature.\n",
    "- **Aggregating on-chain**: Computing things like \"total value locked\" or \"user balances over time\" would be prohibitively expensive if done in smart contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Naive approach to get all Transfer events for an ERC-20**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// This would be impossibly slow\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < latestBlock; i++) {\n",
    "  const block = await provider.getBlockWithTransactions(i);\n",
    "  for (const tx of block.transactions) {\n",
    "    if (tx.to === tokenAddress) {\n",
    "      // parse input data...\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 31.1.2 Event Logs and Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum's event logs provide a more efficient way to access historical data. You can filter by address and topics (indexed parameters). However, even with logs, you face limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RPC node limitations**: Most nodes limit the range of blocks you can query in one call (e.g., 10,000 blocks). To get data over a large range, you must make many requests.\n",
    "- **Centralization**: Relying on a single RPC provider introduces a single point of failure.\n",
    "- **No advanced queries**: You cannot ask \"get me all transfers where amount > 100\" directly; you must fetch all and filter client-side.\n",
    "- **Real-time updates**: Polling for new logs is inefficient and slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, specialized indexing solutions are needed.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 31.2 The Graph Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. It allows developers to define **subgraphs** that specify which events and data to index, and then query them using a standard GraphQL API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 31.2.1 What is The Graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Graph network consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexers**: Node operators that process subgraphs and serve queries, earning GRT tokens.\n",
    "- **Curators**: Signal which subgraphs are high-quality by staking GRT.\n",
    "- **Delegators**: Stake GRT to indexers to secure the network.\n",
    "- **Subgraphs**: Open APIs that define how to index and store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers create subgraphs and deploy them to the network. Indexers then index the data, and applications query the subgraph endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "graph deploy --product hosted-service username/my-token-subgraph\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing locally:** Use `graph test` or run a local Graph node with Docker.\n",
