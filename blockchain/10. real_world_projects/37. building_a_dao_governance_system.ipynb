    "# Chapter 37: Building a DAO Governance System\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent a paradigm shift in how communities coordinate and make decisions. A DAO is an organization governed by smart contracts, where token holders propose and vote on actions, and code executes the approved decisions. In this chapter, we'll build a complete DAO governance system from scratch using OpenZeppelin's battle-tested Governor contracts. Our DAO will include a governance token, a governor contract with voting and proposal mechanisms, a timelock for security, and a treasury to hold assets. We'll also develop a simple frontend to interact with the DAO. By the end, you'll have a functional DAO and a deep understanding of how on-chain governance works.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 37.1 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 37.1.1 Requirements and Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Our DAO will include the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Governance Token**: An ERC-20 token with voting capabilities (ERC20Votes) that allows token holders to delegate their voting power and vote on proposals.\n",
    "- **Proposal Creation**: Any token holder with sufficient voting power (proposal threshold) can create a proposal describing a set of actions (e.g., transferring funds, updating parameters, upgrading contracts).\n",
    "- **Voting**: Token holders can vote \"For\", \"Against\", or \"Abstain\" on proposals during a defined voting period.\n",
    "- **Quorum**: A minimum percentage of total supply must participate for a vote to be valid.\n",
    "- **Timelock**: Approved proposals are subject to a timelock delay before execution, giving users time to exit if they disagree.\n",
    "- **Treasury**: A contract holding assets (ETH and ERC-20 tokens) controlled by the DAO via the timelock.\n",
    "- **Execution**: After the timelock delay, anyone can execute the proposal, which triggers the encoded actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 37.1.2 Architecture Design\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use OpenZeppelin's governance contracts, which are modular and composable.\n",

    "  - `GovernorSettings`: Sets voting delay, voting period, and proposal threshold.\n",
    "  - `GovernorCountingSimple`: Simple for/against/abstain vote counting.\n",
    "  - `GovernorVotes`: Integrates with the voting token.\n",

    "  - `GovernorTimelockControl`: Connects to a timelock controller.\n",
    "- **TimelockController**: Holds funds and enforces a delay between proposal approval and execution.\n",
    "- **Treasury**: The timelock itself acts as the treasury; any contract that needs to receive funds from the DAO should send them to the timelock address.\n",

    "2. **A user with sufficient voting power** creates a proposal by calling `propose` on the governor, specifying the actions (targets, values, calldata) and a description.\n",
    "3. **After a voting delay**, the proposal enters the active state. Token holders vote using `castVote`.\n",
    "4. **After the voting period ends**, if the proposal meets quorum and has more \"For\" votes than \"Against\", it succeeds.\n",
    "5. **Anyone can queue** the succeeded proposal by calling `queue` with the same parameters. This sends it to the timelock.\n",
    "6. **After the timelock delay** (e.g., 2 days), anyone can execute it by calling `execute`.\n",
    "7. The timelock executes the actions, e.g., transferring ETH from its treasury.\n",
