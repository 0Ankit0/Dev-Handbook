    "# Chapter 25: Smart Contract Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is not just a good practice in smart contract development\u2014it's an absolute necessity. Unlike traditional software, where bugs can be patched with a hotfix, smart contracts are often immutable and control real assets. A single vulnerability can lead to catastrophic financial loss, as seen in numerous high-profile hacks. This chapter explores the testing pyramid for smart contracts, from unit tests to advanced techniques like fuzzing and formal verification, using industry-standard tools like Hardhat, Foundry, and Echidna. By the end, you'll be equipped to write comprehensive test suites that catch bugs before they reach production.\n",

    "## 25.1 Testing Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 25.1.1 Why Testing is Critical\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the stakes: a smart contract may hold millions of dollars, and its code cannot be changed after deployment (unless upgradeable, but even then upgrades are risky). Traditional software can rely on post-deployment patches; blockchain cannot. Therefore, testing must be exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consequences of inadequate testing:**\n",
    "- **The DAO hack (2016)**: Reentrancy vulnerability led to loss of 3.6M ETH.\n",
    "- **Parity Wallet hack (2017)**: $30M frozen due to library contract self-destruct.\n",
    "- **Numerous DeFi exploits**: Flash loan attacks, oracle manipulation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing goals:**\n",
    "- Verify functional correctness (does the contract do what it's supposed to?).\n",
    "- Ensure security properties (no reentrancy, access control, etc.).\n",
    "- Measure gas usage (optimize to reduce costs).\n",
    "- Test edge cases (zero amounts, extreme values, unexpected callbacks).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 25.1.2 Testing Pyramid\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing pyramid for smart contracts mirrors traditional software but with blockchain-specific layers:\n",

    "- **Integration tests**: Test interactions between contracts (e.g., a token and a DEX).\n",
    "- **End-to-end tests**: Test the entire system, including frontend (rare in pure Solidity, often in JS).\n",
    "- **Fuzzing**: Automatically generate random inputs to find unexpected behavior.\n",
    "- **Formal verification**: Mathematically prove properties (advanced, used for critical systems).\n",

    "## 25.2 Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit tests verify the smallest testable parts of a contract\u2014usually individual functions. They are fast, isolated, and form the foundation of the testing pyramid.\n",
