    "Gas is the lifeblood of Ethereum\u2014every computation, storage operation, and transaction costs gas. Users pay for gas in ETH, so optimizing gas consumption directly improves user experience and reduces costs. More importantly, gas limits constrain what contracts can do; inefficient code may hit block gas limits, rendering functions unusable. This chapter delves into the art and science of gas optimization, from understanding the EVM cost model to advanced techniques like assembly and Merkle proofs. By the end, you'll be able to write lean, efficient smart contracts that save your users money and keep your protocols scalable.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 27.1.1 Gas Cost Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Every operation in the EVM has a predetermined gas cost, defined in the Ethereum yellow paper and updated via EIPs. Understanding these costs helps prioritize optimization efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major cost categories:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Examples | Relative Cost |\n",
    "|----------|----------|---------------|\n",
    "| **Arithmetic** | ADD, SUB, MUL | Very cheap (3\u20135 gas) |\n",
    "| **Memory** | MLOAD, MSTORE | Cheap (3 gas) |\n",
    "| **Storage (warm)** | SLOAD (already accessed) | Cheap (100 gas) |\n",
    "| **Storage (cold)** | SLOAD (first time) | Expensive (2100 gas) |\n",
    "| **Storage write** | SSTORE (zero to non-zero) | Very expensive (20000 gas) |\n",
    "| **Storage write** | SSTORE (non-zero to zero) | Refund (but costs upfront) |\n",
    "| **External calls** | CALL, DELEGATECALL | Expensive (700+ gas) |\n",
    "| **Logs** | LOG0\u2013LOG4 | Moderate (375 + data) |\n",
    "| **Contract creation** | CREATE, CREATE2 | Very expensive (32000+ gas) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas costs are dynamic:**\n",
    "- **EIP-2929** (Berlin) increased costs for first-time access to storage and addresses to discourage DoS.\n",
    "- **EIP-1559** introduced base fee, but that's separate from execution gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27.1.2 Opcodes and Their Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "A deeper look at common opcodes (based on Berlin/EIP-2929 rules):\n",

    "| Opcode | Gas | Description |\n",
    "|--------|-----|-------------|\n",
    "| `ADD`, `SUB`, `LT`, `GT`, `EQ`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT` | 3 | Arithmetic/logic |\n",

    "**Memory expansion:** When you write to memory beyond previously allocated space, gas costs increase quadratically. The cost formula: `cost = (words * words) / 512`, where `words` is the number of 32-byte chunks allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calldata:** Reading from calldata costs 4 gas per byte (16 gas per word) for non-zero bytes, 4 gas per zero byte? Actually, EIP-2028 reduced calldata gas to 16 gas per non-zero byte and 4 gas per zero byte? Let's clarify: In EVM, `CALLDATALOAD` and `CALLDATACOPY` have costs based on memory expansion and copying; the data itself has no per-byte cost. However, transaction data has a cost: each zero byte in transaction data costs 4 gas, each non-zero byte costs 16 gas (previously 68). This incentivizes using zero bytes.\n",

    "## 27.2 Storage Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage is by far the most expensive resource. Optimizing how you use storage yields the biggest gas savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27.2.1 Storage Slots Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum storage is a key-value store with 2^256 slots, each 32 bytes. Reading or writing a slot costs gas. Contracts pay for each slot they touch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slot layout:**\n",
    "- State variables are assigned to slots sequentially in order of declaration.\n",
    "- Multiple small variables can be packed into one slot if they fit.\n",
    "- Constants and immutables do not use storage; they are embedded in the bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "contract StorageExample {\n",
    "    uint256 a;      // slot 0\n",
    "    uint128 b;      // slot 1 (starts new slot)\n",
    "    uint128 c;      // also slot 1 (packs with b)\n",
    "    uint8 d;        // slot 2 (starts new slot)\n",
    "    uint8 e;        // also slot 2\n",
    "    uint16 f;       // also slot 2\n",
    "    uint256 g;      // slot 3\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `b` and `c` share slot 1 (both 16 bytes). `d`, `e`, `f` share slot 2 (1+1+2 = 4 bytes, leaving 28 unused). This packing saves slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27.2.2 Variable Packing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines:**\n",
    "- Order state variables by size to maximize packing.\n",
    "- Use smaller integer types where possible (but beware of overflow risks).\n",
    "- Group similar types together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Unoptimized vs Optimized**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unoptimized:\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "contract Unoptimized {\n",
    "    uint128 a;\n",
    "    uint256 b;   // slot 1 (starts new slot)\n",
    "    uint128 c;   // slot 2\n",
    "    uint8 d;     // slot 3\n",
    "    uint16 e;    // slot 4\n",
    "    uint256 f;   // slot 5\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Uses 6 storage slots\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimized:\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "contract Optimized {\n",
    "    uint256 b;   // slot 0\n",
    "    uint256 f;   // slot 1\n",
    "    uint128 a;   // slot 2\n",
    "    uint128 c;   // also slot 2 (packed)\n",
    "    uint16 e;    // slot 3\n",
    "    uint8 d;     // also slot 3 (packed)\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Uses 4 storage slots\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Packing savings:**\n",
    "- Each saved slot reduces deployment cost (gas for initializing zero slots) and runtime costs (fewer SLOAD/SSTORE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27.2.3 Using memory vs. storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage** is persistent and expensive.\n",
    "- **Memory** is temporary and cheap (though not free).\n",
    "- **Calldata** is read-only and the cheapest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use memory:**\n",
    "- For local variables that don't need to persist.\n",
    "- For arrays or structs that are only used temporarily.\n",
    "- To avoid multiple storage reads (copy to memory, process, then write back once).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Inefficient vs Efficient**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inefficient (multiple storage reads):\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "function sumArray() public view returns (uint) {\n",
    "    uint total = 0;\n",
    "    for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n",
    "        total += arr[i];  // SLOAD each iteration\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return total;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient (copy to memory):\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "function sumArray() public view returns (uint) {\n",
    "    uint[] memory memArr = arr;  // one SLOAD per element (still cost)\n",
    "    uint total = 0;\n",
    "    for (uint i = 0; i < memArr.length; i++) {\n",
    "        total += memArr[i];  // MLOAD (cheap)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return total;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, copying the whole array to memory still requires reading each element from storage, so it's not necessarily cheaper for reading. However, if you need to modify the array, it's better to work in memory and write back once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calldata:** Use `calldata` for external function parameters to save gas (no copying to memory). Example:\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "function process(uint256[] calldata data) external { // calldata\n",
    "    // data[i] reads from calldata directly\n",
    "}\n",

    "## 27.3 Code Optimization Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27.3.1 Short-Circuiting\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean operators `&&` and `||` short-circuit: they evaluate from left to right and stop as soon as the result is determined. Put cheaper conditions first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "// Expensive condition first: always computes\n",
    "require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount && amount > 0);\n",
    "\n",
    "// Better: cheap condition first\n",
    "require(amount > 0 && balance[msg.sender] >= amount);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27.3.2 Unchecked Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "In Solidity 0.8+, arithmetic is checked for overflow/underflow, which adds gas cost. If you know overflow is impossible, wrap in `unchecked` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "function increment(uint x) public pure returns (uint) {\n",
    "    unchecked {\n",
    "        return x + 1;  // saves gas\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common use cases:**\n",
    "- Loops where `i < max` and max is bounded.\n",
    "- Math where inputs are constrained by earlier checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27.3.3 Custom Errors vs. Revert Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom errors (Solidity 0.8.4+) are cheaper than revert strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Revert string:**\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "require(amount > 0, \"Amount must be positive\");\n",
    "// costs ~200 gas + length*1 gas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom error:**\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "error AmountZero();\n",
    "if (amount == 0) revert AmountZero();\n",
    "// costs ~20-30 gas total\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas savings:** 80-90% on error paths. Use custom errors throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 27.3.4 Efficient Loop Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are a common source of high gas consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips:**\n",
    "- Cache array length to avoid reading it each iteration.\n",
    "- Use `++i` instead of `i++` (pre-increment is slightly cheaper).\n",
    "- Avoid modifying storage inside loops; accumulate in memory then write once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```solidity\n",
    "// Inefficient\n",
    "function updateArray(uint256[] memory values) public {\n",
    "    for (uint i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {\n",
    "        data[i] = values[i];  // SSTORE each iteration\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Efficient: store in memory first? Not applicable; data is storage. \n",
    "// Better: if you must update storage, consider batching.\n",
    "\n",
    "// For reading: cache length\n",
    "function sum() public view returns (uint) {\n",
    "    uint len = data.length;\n",
    "    uint total = 0;\n",
    "    for (uint i = 0; i < len; ++i) {\n",
    "        total += data[i];\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return total;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas savings:** Pre-increment saves ~5 gas per iteration; length caching saves 1 SLOAD per iteration.\n",
