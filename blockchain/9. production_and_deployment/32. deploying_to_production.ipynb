    "# Chapter 32: Deploying to Production\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying a smart contract to a live network (mainnet) is a significant milestone, but it's also a moment of heightened risk. Unlike testnets, mainnet involves real assets and real consequences. A successful deployment requires careful planning, robust infrastructure, and thorough validation. This chapter covers the entire deployment lifecycle—from preparing your contract for production to post-deployment monitoring and maintenance. You'll learn about deployment strategies, infrastructure choices, automated scripts, and best practices for ensuring a smooth and secure launch.\n",

    "## 32.1 Deployment Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.1.1 Testnet to Mainnet\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard path is to deploy first to a testnet (e.g., Sepolia, Goerli) before mainnet. Testnets simulate the mainnet environment but use worthless test ETH. This allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verify that your deployment scripts work.\n",
    "- Test interactions with other contracts (e.g., oracles, bridges) in a live-like environment.\n",
    "- Allow community members to test your application without risk.\n",
    "- Verify contract source code on Etherscan (testnet version).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checklist before mainnet deployment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] All tests pass on local network and testnet.\n",
    "- [ ] Contract has been audited (if high value).\n",
    "- [ ] Deployment address has sufficient funds (ETH for gas).\n",
    "- [ ] Constructor arguments are correct.\n",
    "- [ ] Timelocks or multi-sig are set up for privileged roles.\n",
    "- [ ] Gas estimates are reasonable.\n",
    "- [ ] Contract verified on testnet Etherscan.\n",
    "- [ ] Frontend tested against testnet deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.1.2 Gradual Rollout\n",
    "\n",
    "For high-value protocols, consider a gradual rollout to limit risk:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Soft launch**: Deploy with limited features or caps (e.g., max deposit limit).\n",
    "2. **Time-locked upgrades**: Use a timelock controller so any changes are delayed, giving users time to react.\n",
    "3. **Progressive decentralization**: Start with more centralized control (e.g., multi-sig), then gradually transfer to a DAO.\n",
    "4. **Circuit breakers**: Include pause functionality to halt the contract in case of emergency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Launching a lending protocol**\n",
    "- Week 1: Only whitelisted users can deposit (controlled by admin).\n",
    "- Week 2: Open to public, but with low deposit caps.\n",
    "- Week 3: Increase caps, enable borrowing.\n",
    "- Week 4: Transfer ownership to DAO timelock.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phased approach allows you to monitor behavior and fix issues before full exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 32.2 Infrastructure Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Your DApp needs reliable infrastructure to interact with the blockchain and serve users. This includes RPC nodes, relayers, and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.2.1 RPC Node Providers\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot rely on users' own nodes (most don't run one). You need RPC endpoints for your frontend and backend to query the blockchain and send transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Provider | Features | Pricing |\n",
    "|----------|----------|---------|\n",
    "| **Infura** | Ethereum, IPFS, popular, free tier | Free up to 100k requests/day |\n",
    "| **Alchemy** | Enhanced APIs (NFT, Transfers), good analytics | Free tier, pay-as-you-go |\n",
    "| **QuickNode** | Multi-chain, global nodes | Free tier, then subscription |\n",
    "| **Moralis** | Web3 APIs, database sync | Free tier, then subscription |\n",
    "| **Self-hosted** | Run your own node (Geth, Erigon) | Cost of infrastructure |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practices:**\n",
    "- Use multiple providers for redundancy (fallback).\n",
    "- Rotate API keys and keep them secret (environment variables).\n",
    "- Monitor request limits to avoid service interruption.\n",
    "- For write operations, consider using a dedicated RPC with higher rate limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Fallback provider in ethers.js**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const providers = [\n",
    "  new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/KEY1'),\n",
    "  new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/KEY2'),\n",
    "  new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://eth-mainnet.public.blastapi.io')\n",
    "];\n",
    "\n",
    "const provider = new ethers.providers.FallbackProvider(providers, 1); // 1 = quorum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.2.2 Relayer Services\n",
    "\n",
    "For gasless transactions or meta-transactions, you may need a relayer. Relayers submit transactions on behalf of users, paying gas in exchange for a fee or signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "- **OpenZeppelin Defender Relayer**: Managed relay service with autotasks.\n",
    "- **Gelato Network**: Decentralized relay network.\n",
    "- **Biconomy**: Relayer infrastructure for meta-transactions.\n",
    "- **Self-hosted**: Run your own relayer (e.g., using `ethers.js` and a private key).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Using Defender Relayer**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const { DefenderRelayProvider, DefenderRelaySigner } = require('defender-relay-client/lib/ethers');\n",
    "\n",
    "const credentials = { apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', apiSecret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET' };\n",
    "const provider = new DefenderRelayProvider(credentials);\n",
    "const signer = new DefenderRelaySigner(credentials, provider, { speed: 'fast' });\n",
    "\n",
    "const tx = await signer.sendTransaction({\n",
    "  to: contractAddress,\n",
    "  data: contractInterface.encodeFunctionData('functionName', [args])\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.2.3 Monitoring and Alerting\n",
    "\n",
    "Once live, you need to monitor your contract for unusual activity or failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to monitor:**\n",
    "- **Transaction failures**: High revert rates may indicate bugs or attacks.\n",
    "- **Large transfers**: Unexpected large movements of funds.\n",
    "- **Oracle updates**: Stale or manipulated prices.\n",
    "- **Gas prices**: Spikes could indicate MEV attacks.\n",
    "- **Contract balance**: Should match expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools:**\n",
    "- **Tenderly**: Transaction monitoring, simulation, alerts.\n",
    "- **The Graph**: Subgraph for custom event monitoring.\n",
    "- **OpenZeppelin Defender Sentinel**: Create alerts based on conditions.\n",
    "- **Custom scripts**: Use web3 libraries to poll and send alerts (Discord, Telegram, PagerDuty).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Defender Sentinel rule**\n",
    "- Condition: `event Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 value)`\n",
    "- Filter: `value > 1000 ether`\n",
    "- Action: Send Slack message, email.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 32.3 Deployment Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated, reproducible deployment scripts are essential for consistency and to avoid human error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.3.1 Automated Deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Hardhat or Foundry scripts to deploy your contracts. Scripts should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accept network as a parameter.\n",
    "- Use environment variables for sensitive data (private keys, API keys).\n",
    "- Verify contracts automatically.\n",
    "- Log addresses and transaction hashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hardhat deploy script example:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// scripts/deploy.js\n",
    "const { ethers, network, run } = require(\"hardhat\");\n",
    "\n",
    "async function main() {\n",
    "  console.log(`Deploying to network: ${network.name}`);\n",
    "\n",
    "  // Get signers\n",
    "  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();\n",
    "  console.log(`Deployer: ${deployer.address}`);\n",
    "\n",
    "  // Deploy contract\n",
    "  const Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"MyContract\");\n",
    "  const contract = await Contract.deploy(\"constructor arg\");\n",
    "  await contract.waitForDeployment();\n",
    "  const address = await contract.getAddress();\n",
    "  console.log(`Contract deployed to: ${address}`);\n",
    "\n",
    "  // Wait a few blocks for Etherscan to index\n",
    "  await contract.deploymentTransaction().wait(5);\n",
    "\n",
    "  // Verify on Etherscan (if not local network)\n",
    "  if (network.name !== \"hardhat\" && network.name !== \"localhost\") {\n",
    "    try {\n",
    "      await run(\"verify:verify\", {\n",
    "        address: address,\n",
    "        constructorArguments: [\"constructor arg\"],\n",
    "      });\n",
    "      console.log(\"Contract verified on Etherscan\");\n",
    "    } catch (error) {\n",
    "      console.error(\"Verification failed:\", error);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "main().catch(console.error);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.3.2 Multi-Network Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Manage different configurations per network (addresses, parameters) using a config file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: `deploy-config.js`**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  sepolia: {\n",
    "    uniswapRouter: \"0x...\",\n",
    "    initialSupply: ethers.parseEther(\"1000000\"),\n",
    "    owner: \"0x...\",\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  mainnet: {\n",
    "    uniswapRouter: \"0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D\", // actual Uniswap router\n",
    "    initialSupply: ethers.parseEther(\"10000000\"),\n",
    "    owner: \"0x...\",\n",
    "  }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In your script, load the config based on `network.name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.3.3 Contract Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "Verifying source code on Etherscan (or other block explorers) is crucial for transparency. Users can see that the deployed bytecode matches your verified source.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual verification:** Upload source via Etherscan UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automated verification:** Use Hardhat's `verify` task or `truffle-plugin-verify`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hardhat verify command:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx hardhat verify --network sepolia DEPLOYED_ADDRESS \"constructor arg1\" \"arg2\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**In a script:** Use `run(\"verify:verify\", {...})` as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You must wait a few blocks after deployment for Etherscan to detect the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 32.4 Post-Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "After deployment, there are critical steps to ensure the contract is properly configured and documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.4.1 Ownership Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "If your contract uses an owner role (e.g., `Ownable`), you should transfer ownership to a more secure entity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-sig wallet** (e.g., Gnosis Safe) for team-controlled projects.\n",
    "- **Timelock controller** for DAO-governed projects.\n",
    "- **Burn the owner key** if no further changes are needed (for immutable contracts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Transferring ownership to a Gnosis Safe**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const safeAddress = \"0x...\"; // multi-sig address\n",
    "await contract.transferOwnership(safeAddress);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** A single private key is a single point of failure. If compromised, the attacker could upgrade or destroy the contract. A multi-sig requires multiple signatures, greatly reducing risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.4.2 Initial Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Some contracts require post-deployment setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting up oracles (e.g., Chainlink price feeds).\n",
    "- Adding initial liquidity to a DEX pool.\n",
    "- Whitelisting certain addresses.\n",
    "- Pausing/unpausing (if started paused).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Setting price feed after deployment**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "await contract.setPriceFeed(chainlinkEthUsdAddress);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checklist:**\n",
    "- [ ] All required roles are granted.\n",
    "- [ ] External dependencies (oracles, bridges) are correctly configured.\n",
    "- [ ] Initial parameters are set.\n",
    "- [ ] Contract is unpaused if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 32.4.3 Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide clear documentation for users and developers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contract address** on mainnet (and testnets).\n",
    "- **ABI** and source code (Etherscan link).\n",
    "- **Interface description**: which functions to call, events to listen for.\n",
    "- **Admin roles**: who has what permissions.\n",
    "- **Upgradeability**: if contract is upgradeable, explain the mechanism.\n",
    "- **Security contact**: where to report vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Publish on:**\n",
    "- Project website.\n",
    "- GitHub repository (README).\n",
    "- Developer docs (e.g., GitBook, ReadTheDocs).\n",
