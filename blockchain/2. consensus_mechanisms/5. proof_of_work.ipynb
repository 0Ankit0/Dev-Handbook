    "\n",
    "**Proof of Work (PoW)** is the original consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin and (initially) Ethereum. It requires miners to perform computationally intensive work to add new blocks to the blockchain. This \"work\" involves finding a specific hash value that meets certain criteria, making it prohibitively expensive to attack the network but relatively easy to verify.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Mining Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a lottery where you win by guessing a number. The only way to win is to try guesses repeatedly until you find the right one. In PoW, miners compete to find a \"nonce\" (number used once) that, when combined with block data, produces a hash below a certain target.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **`maxTarget`**: The easiest possible target in Bitcoin (difficulty = 1). All other targets are harder (smaller numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`calculateDifficulty(target)`**: Computes how many times harder current mining is compared to minimum difficulty. Formula: $Difficulty = \\frac{MaxTarget}{CurrentTarget}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`calculateTarget(difficulty)`**: Reverse calculation to find what target corresponds to a given difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`isHashValid(hash, target)`**: Core validation logic. Converts hex strings to BigInt and checks if hash < target numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`adjustDifficulty()`**: Implements Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm:\n",
    "   - Measures actual time vs expected time (2016 blocks \u00d7 10 min)\n",
    "   - Adjusts proportionally but bounded (0.25x to 4x) to prevent manipulation\n",
    "   - If miners are too fast, difficulty increases\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`displayTargetVisual()`**: Shows binary representation to visualize why \"more leading zeros = harder\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5.1.3 Nonce and Hash Searching**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **nonce** (Number Used Once) is the variable miners change to find a valid hash. It's a 32-bit integer (0 to 4,294,967,295) that miners increment in their search for a hash meeting the target.\n",

    "COMPLETE EXPLANATION:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TRANSACTION CLASS:\n",
    "   - Represents a transfer of value\n",
    "   - Contains from, to, amount, timestamp\n",
    "   - Has its own hash for integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "2. BLOCK CLASS:\n",
    "   - Contains multiple transactions\n",
    "   - Has previousHash linking to chain\n",
    "   - Implements mineBlock() with PoW\n",
    "   - Difficulty determines leading zeros required\n",
    "   - Nonce incremented until valid hash found\n",
    "\n",
    "3. BLOCKCHAIN CLASS:\n",
    "   - Manages chain of blocks\n",
    "   - Handles difficulty adjustment algorithm\n",
    "   - Manages pending transaction pool\n",
    "   - Validates proof of work on each block\n",
    "   - Calculates balances by scanning chain\n",
    "\n",
    "4. DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT:\n",
    "   - Every 5 blocks, measures time taken\n",
    "   - If too fast (<50% of expected), increases difficulty\n",
    "   - If too slow (>200% of expected), decreases difficulty\n",
    "   - Maintains consistent block time (3 seconds for demo)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. SECURITY FEATURES:\n",
    "   - Changing any transaction invalidates block hash\n",
    "   - Invalid hash breaks chain linkage\n",
    "   - isChainValid() detects any tampering\n",
    "   - PoW makes recalculating all hashes prohibitively expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a complete, working implementation demonstrating all\n",
    "key concepts of Proof of Work consensus.\n",

    "### **Key Concepts Checklist**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, ensure you understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] How the nonce is used to find a valid block hash\n",
    "- [ ] Why more leading zeros means higher difficulty\n",
    "- [ ] The difficulty adjustment formula and its purpose\n",
    "- [ ] What a 51% attack is and why it's expensive\n",
    "- [ ] The trade-offs between CPU, GPU, and ASIC mining\n",
    "- [ ] How mining pools reduce variance for individual miners\n",
    "- [ ] Why PoW is secure (economic cost of attack)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practice Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explain why finding a valid block hash is difficult but verifying it is easy. What property of hash functions makes this possible?**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **If Bitcoin blocks are being mined every 8 minutes on average, what will happen to the difficulty at the next adjustment? Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate: If the current difficulty target requires 4 leading zeros in hex, approximately how many hashes must a miner try on average to find a valid block? (Hint: Probability = 1/16^4)**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why is a 51% attack theoretically possible but practically difficult? Consider both technical and economic factors.**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compare solo mining vs. pool mining. Why do most miners join pools despite the fees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Explain why ASICs created centralization pressure in Bitcoin mining. Is this a fundamental flaw in PoW or a market evolution?**\n",

    "In the next chapter, we'll explore the consensus mechanism that powers Ethereum 2.0 and many modern blockchains. You'll learn:\n",
