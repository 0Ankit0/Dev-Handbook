    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum may be the most popular smart contract platform, but it's far from the only one. A diverse ecosystem of blockchains has emerged, each with unique architectures, trade-offs, and programming models. Some, like Solana, prioritize high throughput; others, like Cardano, emphasize formal verification; while platforms like Polkadot and Cosmos focus on interoperability. Enterprise solutions like Hyperledger Fabric offer permissioned networks for business use. Understanding these alternatives is essential for choosing the right tool for your project and for appreciating the broader blockchain landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll explore the most prominent blockchain platforms beyond Ethereum, diving into their core concepts, development environments, and unique features. By the end, you'll have a solid foundation to evaluate and build on these platforms.\n",

    "## 24.1 Bitcoin Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is the original blockchain, introduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. While not designed for complex smart contracts, its design—particularly the UTXO model and Bitcoin Script—has influenced many subsequent blockchains. Recent innovations like the Lightning Network and Ordinals have expanded Bitcoin's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24.1.1 UTXO Model Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin uses the **Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)** model, which differs fundamentally from Ethereum's account-based model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How UTXO works:**\n",
    "- A transaction consumes existing UTXOs as inputs and creates new UTXOs as outputs.\n",
    "- Each UTXO is an indivisible chunk of bitcoin associated with a locking script (typically requiring a signature).\n",
    "- Your balance is the sum of all UTXOs controlled by your keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "UTXO Transaction Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Transaction:\n",
    "Alice has UTXO of 10 BTC (requires Alice's signature)\n",
    "Bob has UTXO of 5 BTC (requires Bob's signature)\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction: Alice sends 3 BTC to Bob.\n",
    "- Input: Alice's UTXO (10 BTC)\n",
    "- Outputs:\n",
    "  - 3 BTC to Bob (locked with Bob's key)\n",
    "  - 7 BTC change to Alice (locked with Alice's key)\n",
    "\n",
    "After Transaction:\n",
    "Alice's 10 BTC UTXO is spent (destroyed)\n",
    "New UTXOs: 3 BTC (Bob), 7 BTC (Alice)\n",
    "Bob's original 5 BTC UTXO remains unspent.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of UTXO:**\n",
    "- **Parallelism**: Multiple UTXOs can be spent independently, enabling concurrent transactions.\n",
    "- **Privacy**: It's harder to link addresses (though heuristics exist).\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Stateless validation (no global state).\n",
    "- **Simpler light clients**: Only need to track UTXOs relevant to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Managing UTXOs requires coin selection logic.\n",
    "- **Smart contracts**: Harder to implement stateful contracts (though possible with covenants and taproot).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24.1.2 Bitcoin Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin's smart contract language is **Script**, a stack-based, non-Turing-complete language. It's intentionally limited to prevent infinite loops and ensure deterministic execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key properties:**\n",
    "- No loops (no `jump` opcodes except conditional).\n",
    "- Limited opcodes (~200, but many disabled).\n",
    "- Stateless (no persistent storage).\n",
    "- Executed by every node during transaction validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical script: Pay-to-PubKey-Hash (P2PKH)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Locking script (scriptPubKey):\n",
    "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlocking script (scriptSig):\n",
    "<signature> <pubKey>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution:**\n",
    "1. Stack: [signature, pubKey]\n",
    "2. OP_DUP duplicates pubKey.\n",
    "3. OP_HASH160 hashes the pubKey.\n",
    "4. Compare with pubKeyHash; if equal, continue.\n",
    "5. OP_CHECKSIG verifies signature against pubKey and transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern extensions:**\n",
    "- **SegWit**: Fixes transaction malleability and increases block capacity.\n",
    "- **Taproot**: Enables more complex scripts with Schnorr signatures and MAST, improving privacy and efficiency.\n",
    "- **Ordinals**: Allow inscribing data on satoshis, enabling NFTs on Bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24.1.3 Lightning Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lightning Network is a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin enabling instant, low-cost micropayments. It uses payment channels (see Chapter 16) to move transactions off-chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Two parties open a channel by funding a multisig address on-chain.\n",
    "2. They exchange signed commitment transactions updating balances off-chain.\n",
    "3. The channel can be closed by broadcasting the latest commitment transaction.\n",
    "4. Payments can be routed through multiple channels using HTLCs (Hashed TimeLock Contracts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lightning in practice:**\n",
    "- Wallets: Phoenix, Breez, Zap.\n",
    "- Nodes: LND (Lightning Network Daemon), c-lightning, Eclair.\n",
    "- Routing nodes earn fees for forwarding payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24.1.4 Ordinals and BRC-20\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinals** assign a serial number to each satoshi (1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis) based on the order it was mined. Users can \"inscribe\" data (images, text, etc.) onto individual satoshis, creating Bitcoin-native NFTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BRC-20** is an experimental token standard using Ordinals and JSON inscriptions to create fungible tokens. It's similar to Ethereum's ERC-20 but on Bitcoin. However, it's limited by Bitcoin's script capabilities and relies on off-chain indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example BRC-20 inscription (JSON):**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"p\": \"brc-20\",\n",
    "  \"op\": \"deploy\",\n",
    "  \"tick\": \"ordi\",\n",
    "  \"max\": \"21000000\",\n",
    "  \"lim\": \"1000\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These innovations show Bitcoin's evolution beyond a simple store of value.\n",

    "## 24.2 Solana\n",
    "\n",
    "Solana is a high-performance blockchain designed for mass adoption. It achieves thousands of transactions per second through a unique combination of technologies: Proof of History (PoH), Tower BFT, and parallel transaction processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24.2.1 Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Solana's architecture is built around **Proof of History (PoH)**—a cryptographic clock that timestamps events before consensus. PoH creates a historical record proving that an event occurred at a specific moment, reducing communication overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key components:**\n",
    "- **PoH Generator**: Produces a sequence of hashes where each hash is the output of the previous hash, creating a verifiable time source.\n",
    "- **Tower BFT**: A PoS consensus mechanism leveraging PoH to reduce message passing.\n",
    "- **Gulf Stream**: Mempool-less transaction forwarding; transactions are sent directly to validators.\n",
    "- **Sealevel**: Parallel smart contract runtime (multiple contracts can execute concurrently).\n",
    "- **Cloudbreak**: Horizontally scaled accounts database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Solana Transaction Flow:\n",
    "User → RPC → Leader (Validator) → Gulf Stream → Sealevel (parallel exec) → PoH timestamp → Consensus → Ledger\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accounts model:**\n",
    "- Each account has a balance and can store data (up to 10 MB).\n",
    "- Programs (smart contracts) are stateless; they operate on accounts passed as references.\n",
    "- Rent: Accounts must maintain a minimum balance or be garbage-collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24.2.2 Rust Programming for Solana\n",
    "\n",
    "Solana smart contracts (called **programs**) are written in Rust or C. Rust is the primary language due to its safety and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A simple Solana program (Rust):**\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "use solana_program::{\n",
    "    account_info::AccountInfo,\n",
    "    entrypoint,\n",
    "    entrypoint::ProgramResult,\n",

    ") -> ProgramResult {\n",
    "    msg!(\"Hello, Solana!\");\n",
    "    Ok(())\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key concepts:**\n",
    "- **Accounts**: All data is stored in accounts. Programs are accounts too.\n",
    "- **Cross-Program Invocations (CPI)**: One program can call another.\n",
    "- **PDAs (Program Derived Addresses)**: Accounts owned by programs without a corresponding private key, used for deterministic addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24.2.3 Anchor Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchor is a framework for Solana development that simplifies writing, testing, and deploying programs. It provides Rust macros, IDL generation, and client libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Anchor program:**\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "use anchor_lang::prelude::*;\n",

    "\n",
    "### 24.3.1 Extended UTXO Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardano uses an **Extended UTXO (EUTXO)** model, which enhances Bitcoin's UTXO with the ability to carry additional data and execute scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features:**\n",
    "- UTXOs can contain arbitrary data (datums).\n",
    "- Scripts (validators) decide if a UTXO can be spent based on the transaction and the datum.\n",
    "- Transactions can have multiple inputs and outputs, enabling complex stateful logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EUTXO advantages:**\n",
    "- **Predictability**: Scripts are pure; given the same inputs, the same output.\n",
    "- **Parallelism**: Multiple UTXOs can be processed simultaneously.\n",
    "- **Off-chain computation**: Much of the logic can be handled off-chain, with on-chain validation only.\n",
