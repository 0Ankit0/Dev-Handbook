    "## 50.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility testing tools are essential for efficiently identifying and fixing barriers that prevent people with disabilities from using your application. While manual testing with assistive technologies remains irreplaceable, automated tools can catch a significant percentage of issues quickly and consistently. This chapter explores the most popular and effective accessibility testing tools, how to use them, and how to integrate them into your development workflow.\n",

    "## 50.2 Browser Developer Tools Accessibility Panel\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern browsers include built-in accessibility tools that help developers inspect the accessibility tree, check contrast, and simulate vision deficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 50.2.1 Chrome DevTools Accessibility Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to access:**\n",
    "- Open DevTools (F12)\n",
    "- Go to the **Elements** panel\n",
    "- Select the **Accessibility** tab\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accessibility Tree:** Shows how the page is exposed to assistive technology. You can see computed accessible name, role, and state for any element.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Contrast Ratio Checker:** In the Styles pane, a color picker shows contrast ratio against the background, with a warning if below WCAG thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Full-Page Accessibility Tree:** In the Console, use `getEventListeners()` or `inspect` commands, but a better view is available via the **Accessibility** tab's \"Enable full-page accessibility tree\" option.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simulate Vision Deficiencies:** In the **Rendering** tab (Command+Shift+P, type \"Rendering\"), you can simulate blurred vision, protanopia (red-blind), deuteranopia (green-blind), tritanopia (blue-blind), and achromatopsia (no color).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical usage:**\n",
    "- Inspect an element to see its accessible name and role.\n",
    "- Verify that custom components have correct ARIA attributes.\n",
    "- Check if focus order matches the accessibility tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 50.2.2 Firefox Accessibility Inspector\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to access:**\n",
    "- Open DevTools (F12)\n",
    "- Go to the **Accessibility** panel\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accessibility Tree:** Visual tree view of accessible objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check for Accessibility Issues:** Firefox can automatically audit the current page and highlight issues like missing alt text, low contrast, or missing labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contrast Ratio Display:** Hover over any text element to see contrast ratio against background.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simulate Color Blindness:** Dropdown to simulate various types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Click the \"Check for issues\" button to get a list of accessibility problems with explanations and code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 50.2.3 Safari Developer Tools Accessibility\n",

    "3. **Don't rely solely on scores:** A high Lighthouse score doesn't guarantee perfect accessibility; always supplement with manual tests.\n",
    "4. **Educate the team:** Share tool findings with designers and developers to prevent recurring issues.\n",
    "5. **Stay updated:** Accessibility standards evolve; ensure your tools are up-to-date.\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we explored the essential tools for accessibility testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Browser Developer Tools** (Chrome, Firefox) provide built-in accessibility inspectors, contrast checkers, and vision simulators.\n",
    "- **axe DevTools** (extension and library) is the industry standard for automated accessibility testing, easily integrated into Cypress, Jest, and CI.\n",
    "- **WAVE** offers visual, educational feedback ideal for quick checks and team training.\n",
    "- **Lighthouse** provides comprehensive audits with actionable recommendations, integrated into DevTools and CI.\n",
    "- **Screen readers** (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack) are irreplaceable for testing with actual assistive technology.\n",
    "- **Color contrast checkers** help verify WCAG compliance quickly.\n",
    "- **Keyboard testing** remains a critical manual activity, aided by tools that visualize tab order.\n",
    "- **Linting tools** catch accessibility issues at development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** No single tool catches everything. A robust accessibility testing strategy combines automated checks (for efficiency) with manual testing (for depth). By integrating these tools into your workflow, you can build products that are truly inclusive.\n",
