    "## 62.1 Introduction to Test Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Test management is the process of organizing, planning, controlling, and evaluating the testing activities within a software development project. It encompasses everything from defining the test strategy and allocating resources to tracking progress and reporting results. Effective test management ensures that testing efforts are aligned with project goals, conducted efficiently, and provide valuable insights into product quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 62.1.1 Why Test Management Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "| Reason | Description |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Alignment** | Ensures testing supports business objectives and project timelines. |\n",
    "| **Efficiency** | Optimizes use of resources (people, time, tools). |\n",
    "| **Visibility** | Provides stakeholders with clear understanding of testing status and quality. |\n",
    "| **Risk Management** | Identifies and mitigates testing risks early. |\n",
    "| **Consistency** | Establishes repeatable processes across projects. |\n",
    "| **Continuous Improvement** | Captures lessons learned and improves future testing. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 62.1.2 Test Management vs. Test Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Test Management | Test Execution |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Focus** | Planning, organizing, controlling | Running tests, logging results |\n",
    "| **Activities** | Strategy definition, resource allocation, progress tracking | Test case execution, defect reporting |\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 62.2 Test Manager Responsibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The test manager (or test lead) is responsible for the overall testing effort. In smaller teams, this role may be combined with hands-on testing; in larger organizations, it may be a dedicated management position.\n",
