    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we explored **real-world case studies** from four distinct industries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **E-commerce** (ShopFast): Focused on risk-based testing, automation pyramid, and handling peak traffic.\n",
    "- **Banking** (SecureBank): Emphasized compliance, traceability, service virtualization, and security.\n",
    "- **Healthcare** (HealthTrack): Prioritized patient safety, simulation, usability testing, and regulatory documentation.\n",
    "- **Social Media** (ConnectNow): Addressed scale, continuous testing, canary releases, and chaos engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each case study illustrated how testing principles adapt to context\u2014what works for a social media giant may not work for a healthcare startup, but the underlying principles (risk-based thinking, automation, collaboration) remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** Testing is not one-size-fits-all. The most effective strategies are those tailored to the specific risks, regulations, and business goals of your domain. By understanding how others have succeeded (and failed), you can make better decisions in your own testing journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## \ud83d\udcd6 Next Chapter: Chapter 74 - Industry-Specific Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've seen case studies across domains, Chapter 74 will dive deeper into **Industry-Specific Testing** considerations: fintech, healthcare, e-commerce, SaaS, and enterprise applications. You'll learn about domain-specific challenges, regulations, and best practices to apply in your own context."
