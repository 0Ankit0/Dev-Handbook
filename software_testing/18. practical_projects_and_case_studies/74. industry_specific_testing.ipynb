    "## 74.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Software testing is not a one-size-fits-all discipline. The strategies, techniques, and priorities that work for one industry may be entirely inappropriate for another. Each industry has its own unique challenges: regulatory requirements, domain-specific risks, user expectations, and technical constraints. Understanding these nuances is essential for testers who want to deliver high-quality software in their chosen domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores testing considerations across five key industries:\n",
    "- **Fintech and Financial Services**\n",
    "- **Healthcare and Medical Devices**\n",
    "- **E-commerce and Retail**\n",
    "- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**\n",
    "- **Enterprise Applications**\n",

    "For each industry, we'll examine the regulatory landscape, common challenges, testing priorities, and best practices.\n",

    "\n",
    "Fintech (financial technology) encompasses a wide range of applications: banking apps, trading platforms, payment processors, cryptocurrency exchanges, and insurance systems. The financial industry is heavily regulated because errors can lead to significant financial loss, fraud, or systemic risk.\n",

    "### 74.2.2 Key Testing Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "| Challenge | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Accuracy** | Financial calculations must be exact to the penny (or cent). Rounding errors are unacceptable. |\n",
    "| **Security** | Financial data is a prime target for attackers. Breaches can lead to massive losses and regulatory fines. |\n",
    "| **Auditability** | All transactions must be traceable and verifiable. Testing must provide evidence. |\n",
    "| **Real-time processing** | Many financial systems require sub-second response times (e.g., trading platforms). |\n",
    "| **Integration complexity** | Systems integrate with payment gateways, credit bureaus, core banking systems, and external APIs. |\n",
    "| **Regulatory changes** | Laws change frequently; systems must be updated and retested quickly. |\n",

    "### 74.2.3 Testing Priorities\n",
    "\n",
    "| Priority | Approach |\n",
    "|----------|----------|\n",
    "| **Functional Accuracy** | Extensive unit and integration tests for financial calculations; use property-based testing to cover edge cases. |\n",
    "| **Security** | Penetration testing, secure code reviews, dependency scanning, encryption validation. |\n",
    "| **Audit Trail** | Log all financial transactions; test that logs are complete, accurate, and tamper-proof. |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Load testing for peak times (e.g., end of month, market open); stress testing for extreme scenarios. |\n",
    "| **Compliance** | Traceability matrix linking tests to regulatory requirements; regular compliance audits. |\n",
