    "## **20.1 What is an API?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Defining Application Programming Interfaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it as a **contract** between systems: it defines how requests should be made, what data formats to use, and what responses to expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Analogy:** \n",
    "Imagine a restaurant. The **menu** is the API documentation—it lists what you can order (available endpoints) and what you'll receive (responses). The **kitchen** is the server/backend. You (the client) don't need to know how the kitchen works; you just use the menu (API) to place your order (request) and receive food (response).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Definition:**\n",
    "> \"An API is an interface or communication protocol between a client and a server intended to simplify the building of client-side software.\" — Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why APIs Matter for Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backend Validation:** UI tests verify the frontend; API tests verify the backend logic directly\n",
    "2. **Speed:** API tests execute 10-100x faster than UI tests\n",
    "3. **Stability:** No DOM changes, CSS flakiness, or JavaScript async issues\n",
    "4. **Early Testing:** Test APIs before UI is built (shift-left)\n",
    "5. **Integration Testing:** Verify communication between microservices\n",
    "6. **Security:** Test authentication and authorization at the API layer\n",
    "\n",

    "## **20.2 API Types and Architectures**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **20.2.1 REST (Representational State Transfer)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST** is the most common architectural style for web APIs. It's stateless, client-server based, and uses standard HTTP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Principles:**\n",
    "- **Stateless:** Each request contains all information needed; server doesn't store client state\n",
    "- **Client-Server:** Separation of concerns; UI and backend evolve independently  \n",
    "- **Cacheable:** Responses can be cached by clients\n",
    "- **Uniform Interface:** Standard HTTP methods and resource-based URLs\n",
    "- **Layered System:** Client doesn't know if connected to end server or intermediary\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST Example:**\n",
    "```http\n",
    "GET https://api.example.com/users/123\n",
    "Accept: application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "Response:\n",
    "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n",
    "Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"id\": 123,\n",
    "  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n",
    "  \"email\": \"john@example.com\",\n",
    "  \"links\": {\n",
    "    \"self\": \"/users/123\",\n",
    "    \"orders\": \"/users/123/orders\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **20.2.2 SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOAP** is a protocol-based API architecture that uses XML for message formatting. It's more rigid and heavyweight than REST, commonly used in enterprise/financial systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Protocol:** Strict rules and standards (WSDL, WS-Security)\n",
    "- **Format:** XML only\n",
    "- **Transport:** HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.\n",
    "- **Security:** Built-in standards (WS-Security, encryption)\n",
    "- **Reliability:** ACID compliance, transaction support\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOAP Example:**\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "POST /UserService HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: api.example.com\n",
    "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8\n",
    "SOAPAction: \"http://example.com/GetUser\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n",
    "<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\">\n",
    "  <soap:Header>\n",
    "    <AuthToken>abc123</AuthToken>\n",
    "  </soap:Header>\n",
    "  <soap:Body>\n",
    "    <GetUser xmlns=\"http://example.com/users\">\n",
    "      <UserId>123</UserId>\n",
    "    </GetUser>\n",
    "  </soap:Body>\n",
    "</soap:Envelope>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **20.2.3 GraphQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs developed by Facebook. Unlike REST (where endpoints return fixed data structures), GraphQL allows clients to request exactly what they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Single Endpoint:** Usually `/graphql` for all operations\n",
    "- **Flexible Queries:** Client specifies fields to return\n",
    "- **Type System:** Strongly typed schema\n",
    "- **Introspection:** API self-documenting via schema queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**GraphQL Example:**\n",
    "```http\n",
    "POST /graphql HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"query\": \"query GetUser($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { name email orders { total } } }\",\n",
    "  \"variables\": { \"id\": \"123\" }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Response:\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"data\": {\n",
    "    \"user\": {\n",
    "      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n",
    "      \"email\": \"john@example.com\",\n",
    "      \"orders\": [\n",
    "        { \"total\": 99.99 },\n",
    "        { \"total\": 45.50 }\n",
    "      ]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",

    "\n",
    "While Chapter 15 introduced HTTP basics, API testing requires deeper understanding of method semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **GET - Retrieve Resources**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple GET\n",
    "response = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/users\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# GET with query parameters\n",
    "params = {\n",
    "    \"page\": 1,\n",
    "    \"limit\": 10,\n",
    "    \"sort\": \"name\",\n",
    "    \"order\": \"asc\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "response = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/users\", params=params)\n",
    "\n",
    "# The URL becomes: https://api.example.com/users?page=1&limit=10&sort=name&order=asc\n",
    "\n",
    "# GET with headers\n",
    "headers = {\n",
    "    \"Accept\": \"application/json\",\n",
    "    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer token123\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "response = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/users/123\", headers=headers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing considerations:\n",
    "# - Idempotent: Same request produces same result\n",
    "# - Safe: Should not modify server state\n",
    "# - Cacheable: Responses can be cached\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **POST - Create Resources**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# POST with JSON body\n",
    "new_user = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n",
    "    \"email\": \"jane@example.com\",\n",

    "    files=files,\n",
    "    data={\"description\": \"Monthly report\"}\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing considerations:\n",
    "# - Not idempotent: Creating same resource twice creates duplicates\n",
    "# - Returns 201 Created on success\n",
    "# - Usually returns Location header with new resource URL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **PUT vs PATCH - Updates**\n",
    "\n",
    "**PUT:** Full resource replacement (idempotent)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# PUT - Replace entire resource\n",
    "full_update = {\n",
    "    \"id\": 123,\n",
    "    \"name\": \"John Updated\",\n",
    "    \"email\": \"new@example.com\",\n",

    ")\n",
    "# If any field missing, it might be set to null or default\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**PATCH:** Partial update (not necessarily idempotent)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# PATCH - Update only specified fields\n",
    "partial_update = {\n",
    "    \"email\": \"newemail@example.com\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "response = requests.patch(\n",
    "    \"https://api.example.com/users/123\",\n",
    "    json=partial_update\n",
    ")\n",
    "# Only email changes; other fields remain as before\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **DELETE - Remove Resources**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Simple delete\n",
    "response = requests.delete(\"https://api.example.com/users/123\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete with body (some APIs require confirmation data)\n",
    "response = requests.delete(\n",
    "    \"https://api.example.com/users/123\",\n",
    "    json={\"reason\": \"user_request\", \"confirm\": True}\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing considerations:\n",
    "# - Idempotent: Deleting same resource twice should return 404 or 200\n",
    "# - Returns 204 No Content on success (or 200 with deleted object)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **HEAD and OPTIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# HEAD - Get metadata without body (check existence, headers)\n",
    "response = requests.head(\"https://api.example.com/users/123\")\n",
    "print(response.status_code)  # 200 = exists, 404 = not found\n",
    "print(response.headers[\"Content-Length\"])  # Size without downloading body\n",
    "\n",
    "# OPTIONS - Check allowed methods (CORS preflight)\n",

    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API Definition:** APIs are contracts allowing software systems to communicate. They abstract implementation details, exposing only necessary functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **API Types:**\n",
    "   - **REST:** Resource-based, HTTP methods, JSON/XML, stateless (most common)\n",
    "   - **SOAP:** Protocol-based, XML only, strict standards, enterprise-focused\n",
    "   - **GraphQL:** Query language, single endpoint, flexible data retrieval, strongly typed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **HTTP Methods:**\n",
    "   - **GET:** Retrieve (safe, idempotent)\n",
    "   - **POST:** Create (not idempotent, returns 201)\n",
    "   - **PUT:** Full update (idempotent, replace entire resource)\n",
    "   - **PATCH:** Partial update (modify specific fields)\n",
    "   - **DELETE:** Remove (idempotent)\n",
    "   - **HEAD/OPTIONS:** Metadata inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Status Codes:** 2xx (success), 3xx (redirect), 4xx (client error), 5xx (server error). Each code has specific semantics for API behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Request/Response:** Headers carry metadata (auth, content type), body carries payload. Content-Type and Accept headers negotiate data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Documentation:** OpenAPI (Swagger) provides machine-readable API specs. Postman collections offer executable documentation. Both enable test generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Testing Approach:** Verify status codes, response schemas, headers, and business logic. Treat APIs as contracts—test that they adhere to their specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Independence:** Each test should setup and teardown its data\n",
    "- **Schema Validation:** Validate responses against JSON schemas\n",
    "- **Header Verification:** Check Content-Type, security headers, and custom headers\n",
    "- **Error Testing:** Verify 4xx and 5xx responses are handled gracefully\n",
    "- **Cleanup:** Always delete test data after creation\n",
    "- **Idempotency:** Verify PUT/DELETE are idempotent (same result on retry)\n",
    "\n",

    "## **📖 Next Chapter: Chapter 21 - REST API Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand API fundamentals, **Chapter 21** dives deep into **REST API Testing**—the most common API architecture in modern web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Chapter 21**, you'll master:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **REST API Architecture:** Resources, URIs, representations, and statelessness in depth\n",
    "- **Authentication Mechanisms:** Basic Auth, Bearer tokens, OAuth 2.0, API Keys, JWT handling\n",
    "- **Advanced Request Techniques:** Query parameters, path variables, headers, and body formats\n",
    "- **Response Validation:** JSON schema validation, XML parsing, and data extraction\n",
    "- **Testing Tools:** REST Assured (Java), requests (Python), Postman scripting\n",
    "- **API Test Automation:** Data-driven testing, environment management, and CI integration\n",
    "- **Common API Patterns:** Pagination, filtering, sorting, rate limiting, and versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Chapter 21 is Critical:** REST APIs power the modern web. Mobile apps, SPAs, and microservices all consume REST APIs. Testing these APIs thoroughly ensures your backend logic is solid before the UI is even built. This chapter provides the practical skills to automate REST API testing professionally.\n",
