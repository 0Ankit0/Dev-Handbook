    "## 65.3 The Seven Principles of Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The Foundation Level syllabus emphasizes seven fundamental principles that guide effective testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.3.1 Principle 1: Testing Shows the Presence of Defects\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing can show that defects are present, but cannot prove that there are no defects. Testing reduces the probability of undiscovered defects, but even if no defects are found, it is not proof of correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.3.2 Principle 2: Exhaustive Testing is Impossible\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing everything (all combinations of inputs and preconditions) is not feasible except in trivial cases. Instead, risk analysis and priorities should be used to focus testing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.3.3 Principle 3: Early Testing Saves Time and Money\n",
    "\n",
    "Defects found early in the development lifecycle are cheaper to fix than those found later. This is often referred to as the \"shift-left\" principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.3.4 Principle 4: Defects Cluster Together\n",
    "\n",
    "A small number of modules usually contain most of the defects discovered during pre-release testing, or are responsible for most operational failures. This is an application of the Pareto principle (80/20 rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.3.5 Principle 5: Beware of the Pesticide Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "If the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually they will no longer find new defects. To overcome this, test cases must be regularly reviewed and updated, and new tests must be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.3.6 Principle 6: Testing is Context Dependent\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is done differently in different contexts. For example, safety-critical software (medical devices, aerospace) requires more rigorous testing than a marketing website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.3.7 Principle 7: Absence-of-Errors is a Fallacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding and fixing defects does not help if the system built is unusable and does not fulfill the user's needs and expectations. A system can be defect-free but still fail to meet user requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 65.4 Key Concepts and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.4.1 Test Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "| Level | Description | Typical Targets |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Component Testing** | Testing individual components (units) in isolation | Functions, classes, modules |\n",
    "| **Integration Testing** | Testing interfaces between components | APIs, services, modules together |\n",
    "| **System Testing** | Testing the end-to-end system as a whole | End-to-end functionality, non-functional requirements |\n",
    "| **Acceptance Testing** | Testing from the user's perspective to determine if the system meets acceptance criteria | User stories, business processes |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.4.2 Test Types\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description |\n",
    "|------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Functional Testing** | Testing what the system does (functions, features) |\n",
    "| **Non-Functional Testing** | Testing how the system performs (performance, usability, security) |\n",
    "| **Structural Testing** | Testing the internal structure (code coverage, white-box) |\n",
    "| **Change-Related Testing** | Testing after changes (confirmation testing, regression testing) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.4.3 Static vs. Dynamic Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Static Testing | Dynamic Testing |\n",
    "|--------|----------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Execution** | No code execution | Code is executed |\n",
    "| **Techniques** | Reviews, walkthroughs, static analysis | Test case execution |\n",
    "| **Defect Detection** | Can find defects early, before execution | Finds defects during runtime |\n",
    "| **Coverage** | Documents, requirements, code | Executed code paths |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.4.4 Defect Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical defect lifecycle includes these states:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "New \u2192 Assigned \u2192 Open \u2192 Fixed \u2192 Verified \u2192 Closed\n",
    "  \u2191         \u2193         \u2193\n",
    "  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500 Reopened \u2190\u2518\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Common states:\n",
    "- **New:** Defect reported, not yet reviewed.\n",
    "- **Assigned:** Assigned to a developer for fixing.\n",
    "- **Open:** Developer acknowledges and is working on it.\n",
    "- **Fixed:** Code changes made, awaiting verification.\n",
    "- **Verified:** Tester confirms the fix works.\n",
    "- **Closed:** Defect is resolved and accepted.\n",
    "- **Reopened:** Verification failed or defect reappeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 65.5 Test Design Techniques in Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.5.1 Equivalence Partitioning (Black-Box)\n",
    "\n",
    "Divides input data into partitions (classes) where all values in a partition are expected to be treated the same by the system. Test one value from each partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A field accepts values 1-100 (inclusive). Partitions:\n",
    "- Below 1 (invalid)\n",
    "- 1-100 (valid)\n",
    "- Above 100 (invalid)\n",
    "\n",
    "Test with: 0, 50, 101\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.5.2 Boundary Value Analysis (Black-Box)\n",
    "\n",
    "Extends equivalence partitioning by testing the boundaries of partitions. For a range 1-100, test: 0, 1, 2, 99, 100, 101.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two-value vs. Three-value BVA:**\n",
    "- **Two-value:** minimum, minimum+1, maximum-1, maximum, and just outside boundaries.\n",
    "- **Three-value:** also includes the boundary values themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.5.3 Decision Table Testing (Black-Box)\n",
    "\n",
    "For systems with complex business logic involving multiple conditions. A decision table lists all combinations of conditions and the resulting actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Conditions | Rule 1 | Rule 2 | Rule 3 | Rule 4 |\n",
    "|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n",
    "| Valid card | T | T | F | F |\n",
    "| Sufficient funds | T | F | T | F |\n",
    "| **Actions** | | | | |\n",
    "| Approve | X | | | |\n",
    "| Decline | | X | X | X |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.5.4 State Transition Testing (Black-Box)\n",
    "\n",
    "For systems whose behavior depends on current state. Models the system as a finite state machine with states, transitions, events, and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A login system with states: Logged Out, Logged In, Locked.\n",
    "- Event: valid login \u2192 Logged In\n",
    "- Event: invalid login (3 times) \u2192 Locked\n",
    "- Event: reset \u2192 Logged Out\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.5.5 Statement Coverage (White-Box)\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute all executable statements at least once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:** (Number of statements executed / Total statements) \u00d7 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.5.6 Decision Coverage (White-Box)\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute all decision outcomes (true/false branches) at least once. Stronger than statement coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:** (Number of decision outcomes executed / Total decision outcomes) \u00d7 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.5.7 Experience-Based Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Guessing:** Using experience to guess where defects might occur.\n",
    "- **Exploratory Testing:** Simultaneous test design and execution, learning about the system while testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 65.6 Sample Questions\n",

    "### 65.6.3 Question 3 (K3 - Apply)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A system calculates shipping cost based on order amount:**\n",
    "- Orders under $50: $5 shipping\n",
    "- Orders $50-$100: $10 shipping\n",
    "- Orders over $100: free shipping\n",
    "\n",

    "C) Thorough testing including all test levels and types, with formal reviews and extensive documentation.\n",
    "D) Exploratory testing only, as it finds defects quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** C (Safety-critical requires rigorous, documented testing.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 65.6.5 Question 5 (K2 - Understand)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which of the following is NOT a typical role in a formal review?**\n",
