    "## **13.1 Git Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Version Control?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version Control** (also called Source Control or Revision Control) is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. Think of it as an **undo button on steroids**\u2014not just for the current document, but for your entire project history, with the ability to collaborate with others without stepping on each other's toes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Imagine writing a novel where:\n",
    "- Every time you save, you create a snapshot of the entire book\n",
    "- You can see exactly what changed between any two versions\n",
    "- Multiple authors can write different chapters simultaneously\n",
    "- If someone deletes a chapter by mistake, you can restore it instantly\n",
    "- You can experiment with alternate endings without affecting the main story\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Definition:**\n",
    "> \"Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, and more.\" \u2014 Git Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Testers Need Version Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many testers new to automation treat version control as \"optional\" or \"a developer thing.\" This is a critical mistake. Here's why version control is **non-negotiable** for test automation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaboration:** Multiple QA engineers working on the same framework\n",
    "2. **History:** \"Who broke the login test?\"\u2014Git tells you exactly when and why\n",
    "3. **Experimentation:** Try refactoring without fear of breaking working code\n",
    "4. **Backup:** Your code lives on the server, not just your laptop\n",
    "5. **Integration:** CI/CD pipelines require code to be in version control\n",
    "6. **Traceability:** Link test code to specific application versions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Version Control Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Evolution of Version Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Local VCS (RCS)\n",
    "   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Single user, local only\n",
    "       \u2514\u2500\u2500 Example: SCCS, RCS\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Centralized VCS (CVCS)\n",
    "   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Single central server\n",
    "       \u2514\u2500\u2500 Examples: SVN (Subversion), CVS, Perforce\n",
    "       \u2514\u2500\u2500 Problem: Single point of failure\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distributed VCS (DVCS) \u2605 Current Standard\n",
    "   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Every user has full repository copy\n",
    "       \u2514\u2500\u2500 Examples: Git, Mercurial (Hg), Bazaar\n",
    "       \u2514\u2500\u2500 Benefits: Offline work, multiple backups, flexible workflows\n",

    "## **13.2 Git Branching Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Branching?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branching** allows you to diverge from the main line of development to work on separate features without affecting the stable code. Think of it as creating parallel universes for your code\u2014you can experiment in one universe while the main universe remains stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like a tree:\n",
    "- **Trunk (main/master):** Stable, production-ready code\n",
    "- **Branches:** Features, bug fixes, experiments\n",
    "- When a branch is ready, it merges back into the trunk\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Branching Matters for Test Automation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parallel Development:** QA Team Lead works on reporting infrastructure while Junior QA writes login tests\n",
    "2. **Stability:** `main` branch always has working tests; experimental features don't break the nightly build\n",
    "3. **Code Reviews:** Branches enable pull requests for peer review\n",
    "4. **Release Management:** Maintain tests for different application versions\n",
    "5. **Hotfixes:** Quickly fix broken tests without disrupting new feature development\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Branching Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Strategy 1: Git Flow (Traditional)**\n",

    "- release/*: Release preparation\n",
    "- hotfix/*: Emergency production fixes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Initialize Git Flow (requires git-flow extension or manual workflow)\n",

    "- [ ] Do tests clean up after themselves?\n",

    "- [ ] Proper exception handling?\n",

    "### Reliability\n",
    "- [ ] No hardcoded sleeps (`time.sleep(5)`)?\n",
    "- [ ] Locators are robust (not dependent on dynamic IDs)?\n",
    "- [ ] Tests are independent (don't depend on execution order)?\n",

    "### Security\n",
    "- [ ] No passwords/secrets in code?\n",
    "- [ ] No sensitive data in logs?\n",

    "- [ ] Follows PEP 8 (Python) or team style guide?\n",

    "   - **Trunk-Based:** For high-maturity CI/CD teams\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collaboration:** Use Pull Requests for all changes. Code review prevents technical debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Conflict Resolution:** Pull before push, communicate with team, use `git stash` for quick context switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **CI/CD Integration:** Connect Git to Jenkins/GitHub Actions. Use branch protection. Tag releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Security:** Never commit passwords, API keys, or `.env` files. Use `.gitignore` properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Best Practices:**\n",
    "   - Commit often with meaningful messages\n",
    "   - One logical change per commit\n",
    "   - Keep branches short-lived (hours/days, not weeks)\n",
    "   - Master `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`\n",
