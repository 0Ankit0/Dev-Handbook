    "# **Chapter 37: Security Testing Fundamentals**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Security testing is the process of evaluating a software application to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. Unlike functional testing—which verifies that features work as intended—security testing attempts to break the system by thinking like an attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2025, the average cost of a data breach reached **$4.88 million** (IBM Security Report), with the average time to identify a breach being **277 days**. Security is not a feature that can be added at the end of development; it must be woven into every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter establishes the foundational principles of security testing, the common vulnerabilities defined by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project), and the methodologies used to identify and mitigate security risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **37.1 Security Testing Principles**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **37.1.1 The CIA Triad**\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of information security rests on three pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidentiality**\n",
    "- Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals\n",
    "- **Testing Focus**: Encryption, access controls, authentication bypass attempts\n",
    "- **Example**: Verifying that user A cannot access user B's financial records by manipulating request parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integrity**\n",
    "- Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data throughout its lifecycle\n",
    "- **Testing Focus**: Data tampering, injection attacks, checksum verification\n",
    "- **Example**: Ensuring that transaction amounts cannot be modified in transit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Availability**\n",
    "- Ensuring that systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users\n",
    "- **Testing Focus**: Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities, resource exhaustion\n",
    "- **Example**: Testing that the application remains responsive under legitimate load and resistant to flooding attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "### **37.1.2 Defense in Depth**\n",
    "\n",
    "Security should not rely on a single control point. Defense in depth implements multiple layers of security controls:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Defense in Depth Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer 7: Application Layer (Input validation, secure coding)\n",
    "Layer 6: Presentation Layer (HTTPS, secure cookies)\n",
    "Layer 5: Session Layer (Authentication, authorization)\n",
    "Layer 4: Transport Layer (TLS 1.3, certificate pinning)\n",
    "Layer 3: Network Layer (Firewalls, VPNs, segmentation)\n",
    "Layer 2: Data Layer (Encryption at rest, database security)\n",
    "Layer 1: Physical Layer (Data center access controls)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Implication**: A tester must verify security at every layer, not just the application boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **37.1.3 Least Privilege**\n",
    "\n",
    "Users and processes should operate with the minimum permissions necessary to complete their tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Approach**:\n",
    "- Verify that database connections use limited accounts (not `sa` or `root`)\n",
    "- Test horizontal privilege escalation (accessing other users' data)\n",
    "- Test vertical privilege escalation (user accessing admin functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# VULNERABLE: Application runs with excessive privileges\n",
    "connection_string = \"Server=db;Database=app;User Id=sa;Password=admin123;\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# SECURE: Application uses least privilege account\n",
    "connection_string = \"Server=db;Database=app;User Id=app_readwrite;Password=[encrypted];\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **37.1.4 Fail Secure**\n",
    "\n",
    "When security controls fail, the system should default to a secure state, not an open one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- If authentication service is unavailable, deny access (not grant it)\n",
    "- If input validation fails, reject the input (not sanitize and accept)\n",
    "- If encryption keys are corrupted, prevent data access (not bypass encryption)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **37.2 Common Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The OWASP Top 10 represents the most critical security risks to web applications. Every security tester must understand these vulnerabilities intimately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **37.2.1 A01: Broken Access Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**: Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced. Attackers can access functionality or data they shouldn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Vulnerabilities**:\n",
    "- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: Accessing resources by modifying IDs\n",
    "- **Path Traversal**: `../../../etc/passwd`\n",
    "- **Privilege Escalation**: User accessing admin endpoints\n",
    "- **CORS Misconfiguration**: Allowing malicious sites to make requests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# VULNERABLE CODE\n",
    "@app.route('/api/orders/<order_id>')\n",
    "def get_order(order_id):\n",
    "    # Missing authorization check!\n",
    "    order = db.query(f\"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = {order_id}\")\n",
    "    return jsonify(order)\n",
    "\n",
    "# EXPLOIT\n",
    "# User A (legitimate) accesses: /api/orders/12345\n",
    "# User B (attacker) tries: /api/orders/12346 (belongs to User C)\n",
    "# If no check, attacker sees other users' orders (IDOR)\n",

    "    if not order:\n",
    "        abort(403)  # Forbidden\n",
    "    return jsonify(order)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Cases**:\n",
    "1. Access resources with different user IDs in parameters\n",
    "2. Attempt to access admin endpoints as regular user\n",
    "3. Use HTTP method tampering (change POST to PUT/DELETE)\n",
    "4. Test with and without authentication tokens\n",

    "- **CIA Triad**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability—the foundation of all security testing\n",
    "- **Defense in Depth**: No single point of failure; security at every layer\n",
    "- **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary permissions reduce blast radius\n",
    "- **Fail Secure**: When security controls fail, default to deny, not allow\n",
    "\n",
    "**OWASP Top 10 (37.2):**\n",
    "- **Broken Access Control**: Test IDOR, path traversal, privilege escalation with horizontal/vertical access attempts\n",
    "- **Cryptographic Failures**: Verify strong hashing (bcrypt/Argon2), TLS 1.3, no hardcoded keys\n",
    "- **Injection**: Use parameterized queries; never concatenate SQL; validate all inputs\n",
    "- **Insecure Design**: Race conditions, business logic flaws—test for time-of-check to time-of-use issues\n",
    "- **Security Misconfiguration**: Verify security headers (CSP, HSTS), disable verbose errors, change defaults\n",
    "- **Vulnerable Components**: Maintain SBOM, automate SCA scanning, patch within 30 days of CVE release\n",
    "- **Auth Failures**: Implement rate limiting, account lockout, MFA, secure session management\n",
    "- **Integrity Failures**: Avoid pickle/deserialization of untrusted data; verify dependency signatures\n",
    "- **Logging Failures**: Log all auth events (success/failure), use structured JSON, ensure tamper-proof storage\n",
    "- **SSRF**: Validate URLs against allowlists, block private IP ranges, use network segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threat Modeling (37.3):**\n",
    "- **STRIDE**: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Info Disclosure, DoS, Elevation of Privilege\n",

    "- **Risk Rating**: Likelihood × Impact; focus testing on high-risk components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Types (37.4):**\n",
    "- **SAST**: Source code analysis (SonarQube, Semgrep)—find bugs early\n",
    "- **DAST**: Runtime testing (ZAP, Burp)—finds configuration issues\n",
    "- **IAST**: Instrumented testing—high accuracy with runtime context\n",
    "- **SCA**: Dependency scanning—critical for supply chain security\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authentication Testing (37.5):**\n",
    "- **Session Management**: Test fixation, timeout, entropy, concurrent sessions\n",
    "- **JWT**: Verify algorithm != \"none\", strong secrets, expiration checks, no sensitive data in payload\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Validation (37.6):**\n",
    "- **Boundary Testing**: Empty strings, max length, null bytes, Unicode\n",
    "- **Fuzzing**: Automated mutation testing to find crashes and injection points\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compliance (37.7):**\n",
    "- **PCI-DSS**: Required for payment processing; annual penetration testing\n",
    "- **GDPR**: Privacy by design; right to erasure; breach notification\n",
    "- **Traceability**: Map requirements to test cases for audit evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Testing Best Practices:**\n",
    "1. **Shift Left**: Integrate SAST into IDE and CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "2. **Defense in Depth**: Assume any single control may fail\n",
