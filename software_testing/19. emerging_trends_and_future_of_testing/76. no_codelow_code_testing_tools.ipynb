    "## 76.1 Introduction to No-Code/Low-Code Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The no-code and low-code movement has transformed software development, enabling citizen developers and business users to create applications without writing traditional code. The same revolution is now reshaping software testing. No-code/low-code testing tools allow testers, business analysts, and even non-technical stakeholders to create automated tests through visual interfaces, drag-and-drop components, and natural language instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools do not eliminate the need for skilled test automation engineers, but they democratize test creation, speed up automation, and bridge the gap between technical and non-technical team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 76.1.1 What Are No-Code/Low-Code Testing Tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description | Examples |\n",
    "|------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| **No-Code** | Create tests entirely through visual interfaces, record-and-playback, or natural language. No programming required. | Katalon Studio (visual mode), TestCraft, mabl, Leapwork |\n",
    "| **Low-Code** | Require minimal coding, often for complex logic or integrations. Provide visual builders with code extension points. | Katalon Studio (scripting mode), TestComplete, Tosca |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 76.1.2 Why No-Code/Low-Code Testing Is Growing\n",
    "\n",
    "| Reason | Explanation |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Skill Shortage** | There aren't enough skilled automation engineers to meet demand. No-code tools empower existing team members. |\n",
    "| **Speed** | Visual test creation is often faster than writing code for simple scenarios. |\n",
    "| **Maintenance** | AI-powered self-healing reduces maintenance effort. |\n",
    "| **Collaboration** | Business users can contribute to test creation, improving coverage and understanding. |\n",
    "| **Citizen Development** | As more non-developers create applications, they need accessible testing tools. |\n",

    "## 76.5 Best Practices for No-Code/Low-Code Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 76.5.1 Start with a Pilot\n",
    "\n",
    "Select a small, representative application or feature. Create a few tests in the tool, run them, and evaluate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ease of use\n",
    "- Maintenance effort\n",
    "- Integration with CI/CD\n",
    "- Team adoption\n",
    "\n",
    "### 76.5.2 Combine with Traditional Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "No-code tools are best used alongside traditional approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unit and integration tests:** Still best written in code.\n",
    "- **Complex E2E scenarios:** May need custom code or hybrid approach.\n",
    "- **Exploratory testing:** Still requires human creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 76.5.3 Establish Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like code, no-code tests benefit from consistent naming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test names: `TC001_Login_ValidCredentials`\n",
    "- Component names: `LoginForm_UsernameField`\n",
    "- Test data: `ValidUser_JohnDoe`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 76.5.4 Use Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with visual tools, test assets should be version-controlled. Most tools integrate with Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 76.5.5 Maintain Tests Like Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review test changes in pull requests.\n",
    "- Refactor duplicate steps into reusable components.\n",
    "- Monitor test health (flakiness, execution time).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 76.5.6 Train Your Team\n",
    "\n",
    "Invest in training for both technical and non-technical team members. The tool is only as effective as the people using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 76.6 Integrating No-Code Tests into CI/CD\n",
    "\n",
    "Most no-code tools provide integrations with popular CI/CD platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 76.6.1 Example: Katalon Studio with Jenkins\n",
