    "## 41.1 What is Test-Driven Development?\n",
    "\n",
    "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written *before* the code that makes them pass. It is a disciplined practice that drives the design of the code and ensures that every line of production code is covered by tests. TDD was popularized by Kent Beck in the late 1990s as part of Extreme Programming (XP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.1.1 The TDD Mantra: Red-Green-Refactor\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD follows a simple, repetitive cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Red:** Write a failing test. This test defines a new function or improvement, and it should fail because the feature isn't implemented yet.\n",
    "2. **Green:** Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. Don't worry about elegance—just get the test to pass.\n",
    "3. **Refactor:** Improve the code while keeping the tests green. Remove duplication, improve naming, and optimize structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle is repeated for each small unit of functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.1.2 Benefits of TDD\n",
    "\n",
    "| Benefit | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Better Code Quality** | Tests ensure code works as expected; refactoring keeps it clean. |\n",
    "| **Design Improvement** | Writing tests first forces you to think about interfaces and dependencies, leading to more modular, decoupled code. |\n",
    "| **Living Documentation** | Tests serve as executable documentation that never goes out of date. |\n",
    "| **Regression Safety Net** | As the codebase grows, tests catch regressions immediately. |\n",
    "| **Reduced Debugging Time** | Bugs are caught early, often within minutes of being introduced. |\n",
    "| **Confidence to Refactor** | With a solid test suite, you can refactor fearlessly. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.1.3 Common Misconceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "| Misconception | Reality |\n",
    "|---------------|---------|\n",
    "| TDD is about testing | TDD is about **design**, not testing. Tests are a byproduct. |\n",
    "| You need to write all tests first | No, you write one test at a time, then code. |\n",
    "| TDD slows down development | Initially yes, but over time it speeds up development by reducing defects and rework. |\n",
    "| TDD requires 100% code coverage | TDD naturally leads to high coverage, but the goal is coverage of behavior, not lines. |\n",

    "## 41.2 The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle in Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.2.1 Step 1: Red – Write a Failing Test\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose the smallest possible piece of functionality to add.\n",
    "- Write a test that expresses the desired behavior.\n",
    "- The test should fail for the right reason (e.g., method not found, assertion fails).\n",
    "- Run the test to confirm it fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Python):** We want to add a function that returns the sum of two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_add():\n",
    "    assert add(2, 3) == 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this test will fail because `add` is not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.2.2 Step 2: Green – Make the Test Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write the simplest code that makes the test pass. No extra features.\n",
    "- Don't worry about code quality yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the test; it should pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.2.3 Step 3: Refactor – Improve the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now that the test passes, look for improvements.\n",
    "- Remove duplication, rename variables, extract methods, etc.\n",
    "- Run the tests after each change to ensure behavior remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple `add` function, there may be little to refactor, but in real scenarios, refactoring is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.2.4 Repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can add the next test, perhaps for edge cases like negative numbers or zero, and repeat the cycle.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 41.3 TDD Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.3.1 Keep Tests Small and Focused\n",
    "\n",
    "Each test should verify one behavior. Tests that check multiple things are harder to debug when they fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_add_positive_numbers():\n",
    "    assert add(2, 3) == 5\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_add_negative_numbers():\n",
    "    assert add(-2, -3) == -5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_add():\n",
    "    assert add(2, 3) == 5\n",
    "    assert add(-2, -3) == -5\n",
    "    assert add(0, 0) == 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.3.2 Test Behavior, Not Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Test what the code *does*, not how it does it. This allows refactoring without breaking tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad:** Testing that a private method was called.\n",
    "**Good:** Testing the outcome of a public method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.3.3 Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario and expected outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `test_methodName_condition_expectedResult`\n",
    "- `test_whenCondition_thenExpectedResult`\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- `test_add_whenBothPositive_returnsSum`\n",
    "- `test_divide_byZero_throwsException`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.3.4 Write the Minimum Code to Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Resist the temptation to implement extra functionality. If the test only checks positive numbers, don't handle negatives yet. The next test will drive that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.3.5 Run Tests Frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "Run tests after every few lines of code. The faster you get feedback, the faster you can correct mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.3.6 Use Test Doubles (Mocks, Stubs) Wisely\n",
    "\n",
    "When testing a unit in isolation, mock its dependencies. But avoid over-mocking, which can lead to brittle tests.\n",

    "## 41.4 TDD Code Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.4.1 Python Example: FizzBuzz\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the classic FizzBuzz kata using TDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: First test – return \"1\" for input 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_fizzbuzz.py\n",
    "def test_fizzbuzz_returns_1_for_1():\n",
    "    assert fizzbuzz(1) == \"1\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run: fails (fizzbuzz not defined).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Make it pass**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fizzbuzz(n):\n",
    "    return \"1\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Test passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Second test – return \"2\" for input 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_fizzbuzz_returns_2_for_2():\n",
    "    assert fizzbuzz(2) == \"2\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run: fails because fizzbuzz always returns \"1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Make it pass** (minimal change)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fizzbuzz(n):\n",
    "    if n == 1:\n",
    "        return \"1\"\n",
    "    if n == 2:\n",
    "        return \"2\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works but is not scalable. However, it's minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Third test – return \"Fizz\" for 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_fizzbuzz_returns_Fizz_for_3():\n",
    "    assert fizzbuzz(3) == \"Fizz\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6: Make it pass** – now we see a pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fizzbuzz(n):\n",
    "    if n % 3 == 0:\n",
    "        return \"Fizz\"\n",
    "    return str(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this breaks previous tests (for 1 and 2). So we need to handle the Fizz case only when divisible by 3, otherwise return string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revised:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fizzbuzz(n):\n",
    "    if n % 3 == 0:\n",
    "        return \"Fizz\"\n",
    "    return str(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now tests for 1,2,3 all pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7: Add test for 5 – return \"Buzz\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_fizzbuzz_returns_Buzz_for_5():\n",
    "    assert fizzbuzz(5) == \"Buzz\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 8: Make it pass**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fizzbuzz(n):\n",
    "    if n % 3 == 0:\n",
    "        return \"Fizz\"\n",
    "    if n % 5 == 0:\n",
    "        return \"Buzz\"\n",
    "    return str(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 9: Add test for 15 – return \"FizzBuzz\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_fizzbuzz_returns_FizzBuzz_for_15():\n",
    "    assert fizzbuzz(15) == \"FizzBuzz\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 10: Make it pass** – need to check both conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fizzbuzz(n):\n",
    "    result = \"\"\n",
    "    if n % 3 == 0:\n",
    "        result += \"Fizz\"\n",
    "    if n % 5 == 0:\n",
    "        result += \"Buzz\"\n",
    "    return result if result else str(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All tests pass. Now we can refactor if needed (maybe extract constants, but it's fine).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how TDD gradually builds functionality with tests driving each addition.\n",

    "### 41.4.2 Java Example: Stack Implementation\n",

    "Let's implement a simple Stack using TDD in Java with JUnit.\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Test passes. But this only handles one element.\n",

    "**Step 3: Test multiple pushes and pops**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Test\n",
    "public void testMultiplePushesAndPops() {\n",

    "    assertEquals(1, stack.pop());\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fails because our simple implementation overwrites previous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Make it pass** – use a list\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.util.ArrayList;\n",
    "import java.util.List;\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Unit testing is a natural companion to TDD. In TDD, the tests you write are typically unit tests, but they can also be integration tests. The key is that they are automated and provide fast feedback.\n",

    "### 41.5.1 Characteristics of Good Unit Tests in TDD\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolated:** Tests should not depend on each other.\n",
    "- **Repeatable:** Same result every time.\n",
    "- **Self-validating:** Pass/fail clearly.\n",
    "- **Timely:** Written just before the code.\n",
    "- **Descriptive:** Test name explains the behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.5.2 Test Doubles in TDD\n",
    "\n",
    "When a unit depends on external components (database, API), use test doubles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stubs:** Provide canned answers.\n",
    "- **Mocks:** Verify interactions.\n",
    "- **Fakes:** Lightweight implementations.\n",
    "- **Spies:** Record calls.\n",

    "Example (Python with unittest.mock):\n",

    "### 41.7.1 TDD and Continuous Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD fits perfectly with CI. Each commit includes tests, and CI runs them. If a commit breaks tests, the team is alerted immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.7.2 TDD and Code Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD naturally leads to high code coverage because every line of code is written to make a test pass. However, coverage is a byproduct, not the goal. Focus on covering behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 41.7.3 TDD and Pair Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD works well with pair programming. One person writes a test, the other makes it pass. They can switch roles, ensuring both understand the code.\n",

    "## 41.8 When Not to Use TDD\n",
    "\n",
    "While TDD is valuable, it's not always the best approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exploratory/prototyping phases** – when you don't know what the solution looks like.\n",
    "- **Legacy code with no tests** – adding tests first can be impractical; use characterization tests instead.\n",
    "- **UI automation** – UI tests are often too slow for TDD; use TDD for underlying logic.\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we introduced **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Red-Green-Refactor cycle** is the heart of TDD: write a failing test, make it pass with minimal code, then refactor.\n",
    "- **Benefits** include better design, fewer bugs, living documentation, and confidence to refactor.\n",
    "- **Best practices** include writing small, focused tests, testing behavior not implementation, and frequent test runs.\n",
    "- **Code examples** in Python, Java, and JavaScript demonstrated the TDD workflow for simple katas (FizzBuzz, Stack, String Calculator).\n",
    "- **Common pitfalls** were discussed along with solutions.\n",
    "- TDD integrates well with CI, pair programming, and unit testing frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** TDD is not about testing; it's about **design**. By writing tests first, you clarify requirements, design decoupled interfaces, and build quality into the code from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 Next Chapter: Chapter 42 - Unit Testing Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand TDD, Chapter 42 will dive into the **unit testing frameworks** that make TDD possible in different languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JUnit (Java)** – annotations, assertions, mocking with Mockito.\n",
    "- **pytest (Python)** – fixtures, parameterization, mocking.\n",
    "- **Jest (JavaScript)** – matchers, async testing, mocking.\n",
    "- **Other frameworks** – NUnit, TestNG, Mocha/Chai.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 42 will equip you with the practical tools to implement TDD in your daily work.**"
