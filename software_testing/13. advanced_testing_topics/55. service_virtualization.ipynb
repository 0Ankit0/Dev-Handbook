    "## 55.1 What is Service Virtualization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Service virtualization is a technique used to simulate the behavior of specific components in a service-oriented architecture (SOA) or microservices environment. It creates a virtual version of a service that mimics the behavior of the real service, allowing teams to test their applications without relying on the actual service being available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual service (or \"mock\") responds to requests with predefined responses, emulating the real service's API, performance characteristics, and data. This enables development and testing to proceed even when the real service is under development, unstable, expensive to use, or inaccessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 55.1.1 Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Virtual Service (or API Mock):** A simulated service that stands in for a real dependency.\n",
    "- **Contract:** Defines the expected request and response patterns.\n",
    "- **Stubbing:** Providing canned responses for specific requests.\n",
    "- **Record and Replay:** Capturing real interactions and replaying them in tests.\n",
    "- **Stateful Virtualization:** Simulating services that maintain state across calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 55.2 Why Use Service Virtualization?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Benefit | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Parallel Development** | Frontend teams can work against virtual APIs while backend is still in development. |\n",
    "| **Isolated Testing** | Test your service without dependencies on external systems that may be unreliable or slow. |\n",
    "| **Cost Reduction** | Avoid costs associated with calling paid third-party APIs during testing. |\n",
    "| **Scenario Simulation** | Easily simulate error conditions (timeouts, 500 errors) that are hard to reproduce with real services. |\n",
    "| **Performance Testing** | Virtual services can be configured to simulate realistic latency and throughput. |\n",
    "| **CI/CD Integration** | Virtual services can be spun up on demand in CI pipelines, ensuring tests are repeatable. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 55.3 When to Use Service Virtualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Third-party APIs** (payment gateways, shipping providers, social media) \u2013 avoid rate limits and costs.\n",
    "- **Legacy systems** that are difficult to set up in test environments.\n",
    "- **Microservices still in development** \u2013 frontend can start early.\n",
    "- **Mainframe or mainframe-based systems** \u2013 complex and expensive to access.\n",
    "- **Batched or asynchronous processes** \u2013 simulate message queues.\n",
    "- **Performance and load testing** \u2013 virtualize to focus on your system's behavior.\n",

    "| **Mountebank** | Node.js | Multi-protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SMTP), imposter concept. |\n",
    "| **MockServer** | Java, JavaScript | HTTP/HTTPS mocking, proxying, request verification. |\n",
    "| **Betamax** | Groovy | Record/replay for JVM languages. |\n",
    "| **VCR (Ruby)** | Ruby | Record HTTP interactions and replay in tests. |\n",
    "| **Pact** | Multiple | Contract testing also provides mocks for consumers. |\n",

    "## 55.8 Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 55.8.1 Keep Virtual Services Simple\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual services should mimic the real service's behavior, not its implementation complexity. Focus on the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 55.8.2 Version Your Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Store simulation definitions (JSON files) in version control alongside your tests. This ensures repeatability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 55.8.3 Use Record and Replay Wisely\n",
    "\n",
    "Recording real interactions is great for creating realistic simulations, but be careful with sensitive data. Sanitize before committing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 55.8.4 Simulate Realistic Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "Include edge cases: timeouts, errors, slow responses, large payloads. This tests your application's robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 55.8.5 Manage Lifecycle in CI/CD\n",
    "\n",
    "Spin up virtual services in your CI pipeline before tests run, and shut them down afterward. Tools like Docker make this easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 55.8.6 Avoid Over-Mocking\n",
    "\n",
    "Too many virtualized services can hide real integration issues. Use contract tests to verify compatibility with real services, and only virtualize for isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 55.9 Common Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "| Challenge | Solution |\n",
    "|-----------|----------|\n",
    "| **Virtual service diverges from real service** | Regularly update simulations based on real interactions; use contract testing. |\n",
    "| **Performance mismatch** | Simulate realistic latency; use performance testing with real services periodically. |\n",
    "| **Stateful interactions** | Use tools that support state (e.g., WireMock with scenarios, custom middleware). |\n",
    "| **Authentication/authorization** | Virtualize auth endpoints with proper tokens; use same logic as real. |\n",
    "| **Complex request matching** | Use advanced matching (regex, JSONPath, XPath). |\n",
