    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`MaterialApp`**: The `MaterialApp` widget automatically includes a `Navigator` at the root of the widget tree. This `Navigator` manages the entire app's navigation stack. You don't need to create a `Navigator` explicitly when using `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`.\n",
    "- **`Navigator.of(context)`**: Retrieves the `Navigator` widget that is the nearest ancestor in the widget tree. This is the idiomatic way to get the `Navigator` in Flutter. The `context` parameter is the `BuildContext` from the current widget's `build` method.\n",
    "- **`Navigator.push()`**: Adds a new route to the top of the navigation stack. This causes the new screen to appear. The method returns a `Future` that completes when the route is popped off the stack, allowing you to receive a result from the navigated-to screen.\n",
    "- **`MaterialPageRoute`**: A route that uses a platform-appropriate transition. On iOS, it slides the new screen from right to left. On Android, it slides the new screen from bottom to top. It also handles system gestures (like the iOS swipe-to-go-back gesture).\n",
    "- **`builder` parameter**: A function that builds the widget tree for the new route. It receives a `BuildContext` that is scoped to the new route, allowing the built widget to access navigation methods via `Navigator.of(context)`.\n",
    "- **`Navigator.pop()`**: Removes the topmost route from the navigation stack, effectively navigating back to the previous screen. You can optionally pass a result back to the previous screen by providing a parameter to `pop()`.\n",
    "- **Navigation stack**: The `Navigator` maintains a stack of `Route` objects. Pushing adds a route to the top of the stack; popping removes the top route. The bottommost route is the initial route (the home screen).\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`MaterialPageRoute`**: The most commonly used route type. It automatically selects the appropriate transition based on the platform (iOS or Android). It handles the system back button on Android and the swipe gesture on iOS, providing a native feel.\n",
    "- **`CupertinoPageRoute`**: Always uses the iOS-style transition, regardless of the platform. This is useful when you want a consistent iOS look across all platforms or when building iOS-specific screens in a cross-platform app.\n",
    "- **`PageRouteBuilder`**: Provides complete control over the navigation transition. You can:\n",
    "  - Define custom animations using the `animation` parameter\n",
    "  - Specify transition durations separately for forward and reverse navigation\n",
    "  - Use multiple transitions together (e.g., fade and slide)\n",
    "  - Create complex, custom transitions that don't exist in the built-in route types\n",
    "- **`transitionsBuilder` parameters**:\n",
    "  - `context`: The build context for the route\n",
    "  - `animation`: An `Animation<double>` that goes from 0.0 to 1.0 during the forward navigation\n",
    "  - `secondaryAnimation`: An animation for the previous route's transition (used when you want to animate the outgoing route)\n",
    "  - `child`: The widget built by `pageBuilder` that should be displayed\n",
    "- **`fullscreenDialog`**: When set to `true`, the route appears as a modal dialog instead of a full page. On iOS, this changes the direction of the slide animation (from bottom instead of from right) and adds a \"Cancel\" button in the navigation bar. On Android, it changes the visual appearance to look more like a dialog.\n",
    "- **Common transitions**:\n",
    "  - `FadeTransition`: Animates opacity from 0 to 1\n",
    "  - `SlideTransition`: Animates position using an `Offset`\n",
    "  - `ScaleTransition`: Animates scale (size) from 0 to 1\n",
    "  - `RotationTransition`: Animates rotation\n",
    "  - `SizeTransition`: Animates height (useful for accordions)\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`Navigator.push()`**: Adds a new route to the top of the navigation stack. This is the most common navigation method. The method returns a `Future` that completes when the pushed route is popped. If `pop()` is called with an argument, that argument becomes the value of the `Future`.\n",
    "- **Navigation stack visualization**: Each call to `push()` adds a new route to the stack. Starting from `[Home]`, after pushing to Screen A: `[Home, A]`. After pushing to Screen B: `[Home, A, B]`.\n",
    "- **`Navigator.pop()`**: Removes the topmost route from the navigation stack. This is equivalent to pressing the back button (on Android) or swiping back (on iOS). After calling `pop()` from Screen B: `[Home, A]`.\n",
    "- **`pop()` with a result**: When you call `Navigator.pop(context, value)`, the `value` is returned to the previous screen. The previous screen can capture this value by awaiting the `Future` returned from its `push()` call.\n",
    "- **Multiple pops**: You can call `pop()` multiple times in succession, or use `Navigator.popUntil()` to pop multiple routes at once (covered later in this chapter).\n",
    "- **System behavior**: The hardware back button on Android and the swipe-back gesture on iOS both call `pop()` under the hood. Your custom `pop()` calls behave identically to these system actions.\n",

    "- **Result data type**: The result can be of any type (`String`, `int`, `Object`, custom class, etc.). The type is `dynamic` in the method signature, so you may need to cast or check the type depending on your use case.\n",
    "- **`null` results**: If `pop()` is called without an argument, or if the user uses the system back button, the `Future` completes with `null`. Always handle the `null` case in your code, as shown with `result?.toString() ?? 'None'`.\n",
    "- **Multiple results**: Each `push()` call creates a separate `Future`. If you navigate Screen A → Screen B → Screen C, and Screen C pops with a result, only Screen B's `Future` completes. Screen A's `Future` won't complete until Screen B is popped (which may or may not pass along the result).\n",
    "- **Alternative pattern**: Instead of using `await`, you can use `.then()` on the `Future`:\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`pushReplacement()`**: Replaces the current route with a new route. The current route is removed from the navigation stack, and the new route takes its place. This means the user cannot navigate back to the replaced route using the back button.\n",
    "- **Use case**: `pushReplacement` is commonly used after a login, registration, or onboarding flow. After the user completes these processes, you don't want them to go back to the login screen.\n",
    "- **Navigation stack after replacement**: Starting with `[Login]`, after `pushReplacement` to `Home`: `[Home]`. The `Login` route is completely removed from memory.\n",
    "- **`pushReplacementNamed()`**: A convenience method that combines `pushReplacement` with named routes. It looks up the route builder in the `MaterialApp.routes` map and uses that builder to create the route.\n",
    "- **`RouteSettings`**: The `settings` parameter allows you to attach metadata to a route, such as a name or custom data. This can be useful for:\n",
    "  - Analytics and tracking\n",
    "  - Custom route matching logic\n",
    "  - Passing additional context to the route\n",
    "- **`pushReplacementAndRemoveUntil()`**: A more powerful variant that replaces the current route AND removes all previous routes until a predicate returns `true`. If the predicate always returns `false`, all previous routes are removed.\n",
    "- **Predicate function**: The `(route) => false` predicate is applied to each route in the stack from bottom to top. When it returns `true`, that route and all routes below it are kept. When it returns `false`, that route is removed. Returning `false` for all routes means the entire stack is cleared before adding the new route.\n",
    "- **Alternative `pushAndRemoveUntil()`**: Similar to `pushReplacementAndRemoveUntil`, but pushes the new route instead of replacing the current one. This can be useful when you want to keep the current route in the stack but clear everything below it.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Navigator.popUntil()`**: Pops routes from the stack until a predicate returns `true`. The predicate is a function that takes a `Route` object and returns a `bool`. The predicate is called for each route, starting from the top of the stack.\n",
    "- **Predicate evaluation**: The predicate is called for each route BEFORE that route is popped. When the predicate returns `true`, that route and all routes below it remain in the stack. The routes above it (that have already been checked) are popped.\n",
    "- **`route.settings.name`**: The `name` property of `RouteSettings` allows you to identify routes by a string name. This is useful for `popUntil` when you want to pop until you reach a specific named route. You must set the name when creating the route using `RouteSettings(name: 'myRoute')`.\n",
    "- **`route.isFirst`**: A boolean property that is `true` for the bottom-most route in the stack (the first route pushed). This is commonly used to pop to the root screen.\n",
    "- **Pop two routes**: While you can call `pop()` twice in succession, this is less efficient than `popUntil` and creates a visual flicker as two transitions happen. `popUntil` performs the operation in one smooth transition.\n",
    "- **Custom pop count**: The example shows how to pop a specific number of routes using a counter in the predicate. The counter increments each time the predicate is called (for each route checked). When it reaches 2, the predicate returns `true`, stopping at the 2nd route from the top.\n",
    "- **Common patterns**:\n",
    "  - `Navigator.popUntil(context, (route) => route.isFirst)`: Pop to root\n",
    "  - `Navigator.popUntil(context, ModalRoute.withName('/home'))`: Pop to named route (using `ModalRoute.withName`)\n",
    "  - `Navigator.popUntil(context, (route) => route.settings.name == 'specificRoute')`: Pop to custom named route\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constructor parameters**: Data is passed by defining parameters in the widget's constructor and storing them as `final` fields. This is the simplest and most type-safe way to pass data. The compiler ensures that all required data is provided.\n",
    "- **`required` keyword**: The `required` keyword makes a constructor parameter mandatory. If you try to create the widget without providing this parameter, the compiler will show an error. This helps prevent runtime errors caused by missing data.\n",
    "- **Data model class**: The `User` class is a data model that encapsulates related data. Using a data model (instead of passing multiple individual parameters) keeps the code organized and makes it easier to pass data between screens.\n",
    "- **`fromJson` and `toJson`**: These factory and instance methods allow conversion between the `User` object and JSON (a Map). This is essential when data comes from an API or needs to be stored/sent over the network.\n",
    "- **Accessing passed data**: In the destination widget, use `widget.parameterName` to access the data passed via the constructor. For example, `widget.user.name` accesses the `name` field of the `user` object.\n",
    "- **StatefulWidget with passed data**: When passing data to a `StatefulWidget`, the data is passed to the widget class (which is immutable) and accessed via `widget.dataName` in the state class.\n",
    "- **`initState`**: Use `initState` to initialize controllers or perform one-time setup that depends on the passed data. `initState` is called once when the state object is first created.\n",
    "- **`dispose`**: Always dispose of controllers (`TextEditingController`, `AnimationController`, etc.) in the `dispose` method to prevent memory leaks. This is called when the widget is removed from the widget tree permanently.\n",
    "- **Returning updated data**: After editing data, you can pass it back to the previous screen using `Navigator.pop(context, updatedData)`. The previous screen can capture this data by awaiting the `Future` returned from its `push` call.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`await Navigator.push<CartItem>()`**: The generic type parameter `<CartItem>` specifies the type of data expected to be returned. This provides type safety - the `result` will be of type `CartItem?` (nullable), and the IDE can provide better autocomplete and type checking.\n",
    "- **Returning data with `Navigator.pop()`**: When the user adds an item to the cart, we call `Navigator.pop(context, cartItem)`. This passes the `cartItem` back to the previous screen. The `Future` returned by `push` completes with this value.\n",
    "- **Null result**: If the user navigates back using the system back button (or another `pop` without a result), the `result` will be `null`. Always check `if (result != null)` before using the result to avoid null pointer errors.\n",
    "- **`setState`**: When the result is received and added to the cart, we call `setState` to rebuild the UI. This updates the cart badge and shows a snackbar confirmation.\n",
    "- **Callback pattern**: The `QuantitySelector` widget uses a callback (`onAddToCart`) to communicate the selected quantity back to its parent. This is a common pattern for child-to-parent communication within the same screen.\n",
    "- **Snackbar feedback**: `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar()` displays a temporary message to confirm the action. This provides immediate feedback to the user.\n",
    "- **Type safety**: By using `await Navigator.push<CartItem>()`, the compiler knows that `result` is of type `CartItem?`. This prevents type errors and makes the code more maintainable.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complex data model**: The `BookingRequest` class encapsulates all the data for a booking, including multiple fields of different types (strings, dates, enums, lists, booleans). This keeps related data together and makes it easy to pass between screens.\n",
    "- **Enum usage**: The `TravelClass` enum defines a fixed set of options for the travel class. Using enums provides type safety and makes the code more readable than using strings or integers.\n",
    "- **Calculated properties**: The `calculateTotalPrice()` method computes the total price based on the booking details. This encapsulates business logic within the data model, keeping the UI code clean.\n",
    "- **Multi-step form (Stepper)**: The `Stepper` widget is ideal for breaking complex forms into manageable steps. Each step collects a subset of data, and the final step reviews all the data before submission.\n",
    "- **Accumulating data**: The wizard state holds partial data as the user progresses through the steps. Each step updates specific fields, and the final step creates the complete `BookingRequest` object.\n",
    "- **Validation**: Before moving to the next step, the code validates that required fields are filled. If validation fails, a snackbar is shown to inform the user.\n",
    "- **Date picker**: The `showDatePicker` function displays a platform-specific date picker. It returns a `Future<DateTime?>` that completes when the user selects a date or cancels.\n",
    "- **DropdownButton**: Used for selecting the travel class from the enum values. This provides a user-friendly way to select from a fixed set of options.\n",
    "- **CheckboxListTile**: Used for selecting multiple amenities. Each checkbox independently adds or removes the amenity from the `_selectedAmenities` list.\n",
    "- **SwitchListTile**: Used for the binary insurance choice. It's more touch-friendly than a standard checkbox and clearly indicates an on/off state.\n",
    "- **Final assembly**: When the user completes all steps, the `BookingRequest` object is created with all the accumulated data and passed back via `Navigator.pop()`.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`routes` map**: The `routes` parameter in `MaterialApp` takes a `Map<String, WidgetBuilder>`. The keys are route names (strings that look like paths), and the values are functions that build the screen widgets.\n",
    "- **Home route (`'/'`)**: The `'/'` route is conventionally used as the home or initial route. It's the root of your app's navigation hierarchy.\n",
    "- **`Navigator.pushNamed()`**: This method looks up the route name in the `routes` map and navigates to the corresponding screen. It's equivalent to calling `Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => ...))` but uses the pre-defined route from the map.\n",
    "- **`initialRoute`**: Specifies which route to show when the app first launches. If not set, `'/'` is used by default. This is useful for showing a splash screen, login screen, or onboarding flow on first launch.\n",
    "- **`onUnknownRoute`**: Called when a route name is not found in the `routes` map. This is essential for handling invalid routes (typos, deep links to non-existent pages, etc.). You typically show a \"404 Not Found\" screen.\n",
    "- **Route naming convention**: Use path-like strings (e.g., `'/profile'`, `'/settings'`, `'/product/123'`) for route names. This makes deep linking easier and aligns with web conventions if you later add web support.\n",
    "- **Centralized route management**: All routes are defined in one place (the `routes` map), making it easy to see all possible screens in your app and ensuring consistency in navigation.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`arguments` parameter**: When calling `Navigator.pushNamed()`, you can pass an `arguments` parameter. This can be any type: a `Map`, a custom object, a primitive type, etc. The arguments are stored in the `RouteSettings` of the pushed route.\n",
    "- **`ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments`**: In the destination screen, use `ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments` to retrieve the arguments passed to the route. `ModalRoute` is the base class for most routes (like `MaterialPageRoute`), and its `settings` property contains the `arguments`.\n",
    "- **Type checking**: Always check the type of arguments before using them. Use `is` to check if arguments are of the expected type. This prevents runtime errors when arguments are missing or of the wrong type.\n",
    "- **Map arguments**: Using a `Map<String, dynamic>` is a common pattern for passing multiple named arguments. This is flexible and works well when you have several parameters to pass.\n",
    "- **Object arguments**: You can also pass custom objects (like `User` or `Product`) directly as arguments. This is more type-safe than maps, as the compiler can verify the object's structure.\n",
    "- **`?` (null-safe)**: `ModalRoute.of(context)` returns `ModalRoute<dynamic>?`, which can be `null`. The `?.` (null-aware) operator safely accesses `settings.arguments`, returning `null` if `ModalRoute.of(context)` is `null`.\n",
    "- **Error handling**: If arguments are missing or invalid, show an error screen or handle the situation gracefully. This is important for deep linking, where users might navigate directly to a screen without providing the expected arguments.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Navigator.pushNamed()`**: The standard method for navigating to a named route. It adds the route to the navigation stack, allowing the user to go back using the back button or a swipe gesture.\n",
    "- **`Navigator.pushReplacementNamed()`**: Replaces the current route with the named route. The current route is removed from the stack, so the user cannot navigate back to it. This is the named route equivalent of `pushReplacement`.\n",
    "- **Use case for `pushReplacementNamed`**: After a successful login, you typically use `pushReplacementNamed` to navigate to the home screen. This prevents the user from going back to the login screen using the back button.\n",
    "- **`Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil()`**: A powerful method that pushes a named route AND removes routes from the stack based on a predicate. The predicate is a function that takes a `Route` and returns a `bool`. Routes are removed from the top until the predicate returns `true`.\n",
    "- **`pushNamedAndRemoveUntil` predicate**: When the predicate returns `false` for all routes, all previous routes are removed. When it returns `true`, that route and all routes below it are kept. This is useful for:\n",
    "  - Clearing the entire stack after logout\n",
    "  - Resetting to a specific screen after completing a flow\n",
    "  - Implementing \"deep navigation\" that replaces intermediate screens\n",
    "- **`Navigator.popUntil()`**: Pops routes from the stack until a predicate returns `true`. This is useful for:\n",
    "  - Going back multiple screens at once\n",
    "  - Returning to a specific screen (e.g., home) from anywhere in the app\n",
    "- **`ModalRoute.withName()`**: A helper that creates a predicate which returns `true` for routes with a specific name. This is a convenient way to pop until a named route is reached.\n",
    "- **`automaticallyImplyLeading: false`**: In the `AppBar`, setting `automaticallyImplyLeading` to `false` removes the back button. This is useful for screens where you don't want the user to go back (e.g., after login).\n",

    "  - `arguments`: Any data passed to the route via `Navigator.pushNamed(context, route, arguments: data)`\n",
    "- **Return value**: `onGenerateRoute` must return a `Route` object (typically `MaterialPageRoute` or `CupertinoPageRoute`) or `null`. If it returns `null`, `onUnknownRoute` is called.\n",
    "- **Dynamic route generation**: The `switch` statement checks the route name and generates the appropriate screen. This allows for conditional logic based on the route, arguments, or other factors.\n",
    "- **Passing `settings` to `MaterialPageRoute`**: By passing `settings: settings` to the route constructor, the route's settings (including name and arguments) are preserved. This is important for retrieving arguments in the destination screen.\n",
    "- **`print` statements**: The example prints the route name and arguments to the console. This is useful for debugging navigation flow and understanding what data is being passed.\n",
    "- **`onUnknownRoute` fallback**: When `onGenerateRoute` returns `null` (for unknown routes), `onUnknownRoute` is called. This provides a consistent way to handle 404 errors.\n",
    "- **`initialRoute`**: When the app starts, `onGenerateRoute` is called with the `initialRoute` value. This ensures that even the initial route goes through the same route generation logic.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Path-based parameters**: Instead of using `arguments`, you can embed parameters directly in the route path (e.g., `/product/123`). This is similar to REST API URLs and makes routes more readable.\n",
    "- **`split('/')`**: The `split` method splits the path string by the `/` delimiter, creating a list of path segments. For `/product/123`, `split('/')` returns `['', 'product', '123']`. Note that the first element is an empty string because the path starts with `/`.\n",
    "- **Accessing segments**: After splitting, you can access segments by index:\n",
    "  - `parts[0]`: `''` (empty string before the first `/`)\n",
    "  - `parts[1]`: `'product'` (the first segment)\n",
    "  - `parts[2]`: `'123'` (the second segment - the ID)\n",
    "- **Complex paths**: For nested paths like `/category/electronics/product/123`, `split('/')` returns `['', 'category', 'electronics', 'product', '123']`. You can extract multiple parameters:\n",
    "  - `parts[2]`: `'electronics'` (the category)\n",
    "  - `parts[4]`: `'123'` (the product ID)\n",
    "- **`startsWith()`**: Before attempting to split, check if the route starts with a specific pattern using `startsWith()`. This prevents errors when the route doesn't match the expected pattern.\n",
    "- **Length checking**: Always check `parts.length` before accessing indices to avoid `RangeError`. For `/category/electronics/product/123`, we check `parts.length >= 5` before accessing `parts[4]`.\n",
    "- **Optional parameters**: The `category` parameter in `ProductScreen` is optional (`String?`). This allows the same screen to handle both `/product/123` (no category) and `/category/electronics/product/123` (with category).\n",
    "- **Web compatibility**: Path-based parameters are particularly useful for web support, where the URL in the browser address bar shows the current route. This enables deep linking and sharing specific URLs.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separate route generation function**: Moving `_generateRoute` to a separate static function makes the code cleaner and more maintainable. It also makes the function easier to test independently.\n",
    "- **Route map**: A `Map<String, RouteBuilder>` stores static route builders. This provides a centralized registry of all routes, making it easy to add, remove, or modify routes.\n",
    "- **`RouteBuilder` abstract class**: Defines a consistent interface for all route builders. Each builder implements the `build` method, which takes `RouteSettings` and returns a `Route`. This pattern is extensible and testable.\n",
    "- **Individual builder classes**: Each route has its own builder class (`HomeBuilder`, `ProductBuilder`, etc.). This encapsulates the logic for building that specific route, including parameter extraction and validation.\n",
    "- **Error handling in builders**: Each builder validates the route and parameters before building the screen. If validation fails, it returns an `ErrorScreen`. This prevents crashes and provides user-friendly error messages.\n",
    "- **Complex route parsing**: The `OrderBuilder` handles routes with multiple parameters (`/order/:orderId/item/:itemId`). It checks the path length and extracts multiple parameters by index.\n",
    "- **Null safety**: The code uses `settings.name?.split('/')` and `?? []` to handle null values safely. This prevents runtime errors when the route name is null or the path is malformed.\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: To add a new route, you simply:\n",
    "  1. Create a new builder class extending `RouteBuilder`\n",
    "  2. Add an entry to the `_routeBuilders` map (for static routes) or add a check in `_generateRoute` (for dynamic routes)\n",
    "- **Separation of concerns**: This architecture separates:\n",
    "  - Route registration (the map)\n",
    "  - Route generation (the `_generateRoute` function)\n",
    "  - Route building (individual builder classes)\n",
    "  - Screen rendering (the screen widgets)\n",

    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we covered the fundamentals of navigation and routing in Flutter:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigator Widget**: The `Navigator` manages a stack of `Route` objects, handling the navigation stack for your app. It's automatically included in `MaterialApp` and `CupertinoApp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Route Classes**: Flutter provides several route types:\n",
    "   - `MaterialPageRoute`: Platform-appropriate transitions\n",
    "   - `CupertinoPageRoute`: iOS-style transitions\n",
    "   - `PageRouteBuilder`: Custom transitions with full control\n",
    "   - `fullscreenDialog`: Modal-style pages\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Navigation Methods**:\n",
    "   - `push()`: Add a route to the stack\n",
    "   - `pop()`: Remove the top route from the stack\n",
    "   - `pushReplacement()`: Replace the current route\n",
    "   - `popUntil()`: Pop multiple routes based on a predicate\n",
    "   - `pushAndRemoveUntil()`: Push and remove routes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Passing Data**:\n",
    "   - **Forward direction**: Pass data via constructor parameters\n",
    "   - **Backward direction**: Return data using `Navigator.pop(context, result)` and capture it with `await Navigator.push()`\n",
    "   - **Complex objects**: Use data models to encapsulate related data\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Named Routes**:\n",
    "   - Define routes in a `Map<String, WidgetBuilder>` in `MaterialApp`\n",
    "   - Navigate using `Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/route')`\n",
    "   - Use `pushReplacementNamed` and `pushNamedAndRemoveUntil` for different behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Named Route Arguments**:\n",
    "   - Pass arguments via the `arguments` parameter\n",
    "   - Retrieve arguments using `ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments`\n",
    "   - Always check argument types before using them\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`onGenerateRoute`**:\n",
    "   - Provides a callback for dynamic route generation\n",
    "   - Called whenever a named route is pushed\n",
    "   - Allows parsing route parameters from the path\n",
    "   - Return `null` to trigger `onUnknownRoute`\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **`onUnknownRoute`**:\n",
    "   - Fallback for undefined routes (404 handler)\n",
    "   - Called when `onGenerateRoute` returns `null`\n",
    "   - Show a user-friendly error screen\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Route Settings**:\n",
    "   - Contains the route name and arguments\n",
    "   - Can be passed to route constructors\n",
    "   - Essential for deep linking and web support\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the fundamentals of navigation and routing, the next chapter will cover deep linking and Navigation 2.0, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Router and RouteInformationParser\n",
    "- Declarative routing with Navigator 2.0\n",
    "- URL-based navigation (web support)\n",
    "- Deep linking configuration (Android/iOS)\n",
    "- Universal Links and App Links\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**End of Chapter 16**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Next Chapter: Chapter 17 - Deep Linking & Navigation 2.0**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 17 will explore Flutter's advanced navigation system (Navigator 2.0), which provides a declarative API for managing the navigation stack. You'll learn how to handle deep links, support web URLs, and implement more complex navigation patterns that are impossible with Navigator 1.0."
