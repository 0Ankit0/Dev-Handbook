    "## **4.1 Variables, Constants, and Type Inference**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dart is a statically-typed language, which means variables have types that are checked at compile time. However, Dart also has type inference, allowing the compiler to determine the type of a variable automatically in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Declaring Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using `var` for Type Inference**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `var` keyword tells Dart to infer the type of the variable from its initial value. Once assigned, the type cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  // Dart infers the type from the initial value\n",
    "  var name = 'John Doe';\n",
    "  // The type is inferred as String because the initial value is a string literal\n",
    "  \n",
    "  var age = 30;\n",
    "  // The type is inferred as int because the initial value is an integer literal\n",
    "  \n",
    "  var height = 5.9;\n",
    "  // The type is inferred as double because the initial value is a floating-point literal\n",
    "  \n",
    "  var isStudent = false;\n",
    "  // The type is inferred as bool because the initial value is a boolean literal\n",
    "  \n",
    "  var grades = [95, 87, 92];\n",
    "  // The type is inferred as List<int> because the initial value is a list of integers\n",
    "  \n",
    "  var person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30};\n",
    "  // The type is inferred as Map<String, Object> because the initial value is a map\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Print the variables\n",
    "  print('Name: $name, type: ${name.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  // String interpolation: $name inserts the value of name\n",
    "  // runtimeType returns the actual runtime type of the object\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('Age: $age, type: ${age.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('Height: $height, type: ${height.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('Is Student: $isStudent, type: ${isStudent.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('Grades: $grades, type: ${grades.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('Person: $person, type: ${person.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Once a type is inferred, it cannot be changed\n",
    "  // This would cause a compile-time error:\n",
    "  // name = 42;  // Error: A value of type 'int' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'String'.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // However, you can assign a new value of the same type\n",
    "  name = 'Jane Doe';\n",
    "  print('Updated Name: $name');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  age = 31;\n",
    "  print('Updated Age: $age');\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`var`**: Declares a variable with type inference. The type is determined from the initial value.\n",
    "- **Type inference**: Dart analyzes the initial value and determines the appropriate type. For example, `'John Doe'` is a string literal, so `name` is inferred as `String`.\n",
    "- **`runtimeType`**: Returns the actual runtime type of an object. This is useful for debugging and understanding what type Dart inferred.\n",
    "- **String interpolation**: Dart allows you to embed expressions in string literals using `$` for simple variables or `${}` for expressions.\n",
    "- **Type safety**: Once a type is inferred, you cannot assign a value of a different type. This would cause a compile-time error, catching bugs early.\n",
    "- **Reassignment**: You can assign a new value to a `var` variable, but the new value must be of the same (or compatible) type as the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using Explicit Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also explicitly specify the type of a variable. This is useful when you want to be clear about the expected type or when the initial value doesn't provide enough information.\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  // Explicitly typed variables\n",
    "  String name = 'John Doe';\n",
    "  // The variable is explicitly declared as String\n",
    "  \n",
    "  int age = 30;\n",
    "  // The variable is explicitly declared as int\n",
    "  \n",
    "  double height = 5.9;\n",
    "  // The variable is explicitly declared as double\n",
    "  \n",
    "  bool isStudent = false;\n",
    "  // The variable is explicitly declared as bool\n",
    "  \n",
    "  List<int> grades = [95, 87, 92];\n",
    "  // The variable is explicitly declared as List<int>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Map<String, Object> person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30};\n",
    "  // The variable is explicitly declared as Map<String, Object>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Print the variables\n",
    "  print('Name: $name, type: ${name.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('Age: $age, type: ${age.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('Height: $height, type: ${height.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('Is Student: $isStudent, type: ${isStudent.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('Grades: $grades, type: ${grades.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('Person: $person, type: ${person.runtimeType}');\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Explicit types make the code more self-documenting\n",
    "  // They also allow for more precise type checking\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explicit types**: You can specify the type directly before the variable name. This makes the code more self-documenting and can help with type checking.\n",
    "- **`String`**: The type for text strings.\n",
    "- **`int`**: The type for integer numbers.\n",
    "- **`double`**: The type for floating-point numbers.\n",
    "- **`bool`**: The type for boolean values (`true` or `false`).\n",
    "- **`List<int>`**: A list (dynamic array) that contains integers. The generic type parameter `<int>` specifies the type of elements the list can contain.\n",
    "- **`Map<String, Object>`**: A map (dictionary) with string keys and values of type `Object` (any type). The generic type parameters `<String, Object>` specify the key and value types.\n",
    "- Explicit types are useful when:\n",
    "  - The initial value is `null` (before null safety, or with nullable types)\n",
    "  - You want to make the code more readable\n",
    "  - You need to specify a more specific type than what would be inferred\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use `var` vs. Explicit Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  // Use var when the type is obvious from the initial value\n",
    "  var name = 'John Doe';  // Good: The type is obvious\n",
    "  var age = 30;          // Good: The type is obvious\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Use explicit types when the type is not obvious or for clarity\n",
    "  String? nullableName = getName();  // Good: The type is nullable String\n",
    "  List<String> names = [];            // Good: An empty list, so the type isn't obvious\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Use explicit types for API types or complex types\n",
    "  Future<void> fetchData() async {\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Use var for local variables where the type is clear\n",
    "  var result = calculate();\n",
    "  // Good: The type of calculate() is clear from its name\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // But use explicit types if the function returns a complex type\n",
    "  Map<String, List<int>> complexData = getComplexData();\n",
    "  // Good: The type is complex, so explicit typing helps readability\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "String? getName() {\n",
    "  // Returns a nullable String (can be null)\n",
    "  return null;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "int calculate() {\n",
    "  // Returns an int\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Map<String, List<int>> getComplexData() {\n",
    "  // Returns a complex type\n",
    "  return {'category1': [1, 2, 3], 'category2': [4, 5, 6]};\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `var`**: When the type is obvious from the initial value. This reduces verbosity while maintaining type safety.\n",
    "- **Use explicit types**: When:\n",
    "  - The type is not obvious from the initial value (e.g., an empty list or `null`)\n",
    "  - You want to make the code more self-documenting\n",
    "  - The type is complex or important for understanding the code\n",
    "- **Nullable types**: The `?` suffix indicates that a type can be `null`. For example, `String?` can be `null` or a `String`.\n",
    "- **Empty collections**: When you create an empty list or map, the type isn't obvious from the initial value, so explicit typing is helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Constants: `final` and `const`**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dart, `final` and `const` are used to declare constants, but they have different meanings and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using `final`**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `final` variable can be set only once. It must be initialized either when declared or in the constructor/initializer list. Once initialized, its value cannot be changed.\n",

    "- **Reassignment**: Once initialized, a `final` variable cannot be reassigned. Attempting to do so causes a compile-time error.\n",
    "- **Collection contents**: While a `final` collection variable cannot be reassigned, the contents of the collection can still be modified. The `final` keyword only prevents reassigning the variable itself, not modifying the object it references.\n",
    "- **Runtime initialization**: `final` variables can be initialized with values determined at runtime (e.g., `DateTime.now()`). This is different from `const`, which requires compile-time constants.\n",
    "- **Instance variables**: `final` is commonly used for instance variables that should not be changed after initialization. In the constructor, the `this.name` syntax initializes the `final` field.\n",
    "- **Immutability**: `final` provides a level of immutability for variables, ensuring they are not accidentally reassigned.\n",

    "- **Const contexts**: `const` variables can be used in other `const` contexts, such as other `const` variable initializations.\n",
    "- **Canonicalization**: Dart canonicalizes `const` instances, meaning that identical `const` values refer to the same object in memory. This can save memory and improve performance.\n",
    "- **`identical()`**: Returns `true` if both arguments refer to the same object in memory. This is useful for checking object identity.\n",
    "- **Const constructors**: A `const` constructor allows instances of a class to be compile-time constants. All instance variables must be `final`, and the constructor body must be empty.\n",

    "- **Use `const`**: For values that are known at compile time and will never change. This improves performance by allowing compile-time optimizations and canonicalization.\n",
    "- **Use `final`**: For values that are determined at runtime but shouldn't change afterward. This ensures the variable isn't accidentally reassigned.\n",
    "- **Use `var`**: For local variables when the type is obvious from the initial value. This reduces verbosity.\n",
    "- **Use explicit types**: When the type is not obvious from the initial value (e.g., empty collections) or when you want to make the code more self-documenting.\n",

    "### **Null Safety Operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dart's null safety feature introduces several operators for working with nullable types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The `?` Operator (Nullable Type)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Marks a type as nullable, allowing it to hold null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  // Non-nullable (cannot be null)\n",
    "  String name = 'John';\n",
    "  // name = null;  // Error\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Nullable (can be null)\n",
    "  String? nullableName = 'John';\n",
    "  nullableName = null;  // OK\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('Nullable Name: $nullableName');\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`String?`**: A nullable String type. Can hold either a `String` value or `null`.\n",
    "- **`String`**: A non-nullable String type. Cannot hold `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The `!` Operator (Null Assertion)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tells the compiler that a nullable expression is definitely not null. Use with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  String? name = getName();\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // If we know name is not null, we can use !\n",
    "  if (name != null) {\n",
    "    print('Name length: ${name.length}');  // OK, compiler knows name is not null here\n",
    "  }\n",

    "  // Or use ! to assert non-null\n",
    "  String definiteName = name!;\n",
    "  // Tells compiler: \"Trust me, name is not null\"\n",
    "  // If name is actually null, this throws a runtime error\n",

    "\n",
    "String? getName() {\n",
    "  return 'John';\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`!`**: The null assertion operator (also called the bang operator). Tells the compiler to treat a nullable expression as non-nullable.\n",
    "- **Runtime error**: If the expression is actually null when using `!`, a runtime error occurs.\n",
    "- **Safe usage**: Only use `!` when you are certain the value is not null, typically after a null check.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The `??` Operator (Null-Coalescing)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns the left operand if it's not null, otherwise returns the right operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-nullable by default**: Dart variables are non-nullable by default. This prevents null reference errors at compile time.\n",
    "- **Nullable types**: Use `?` to mark a type as nullable. Only use this when the variable genuinely might be null.\n",
    "- **Initialization**: Initialize variables before use. Accessing a nullable variable without checking for null can cause runtime errors.\n",
    "- **Late initialization**: Use `late` for lazy initialization. The value is computed only when first accessed.\n",
    "- **Final**: Use `final` for variables that won't change after initialization.\n",
    "- **Const**: Use `const` for compile-time constants.\n",
    "- **Null-aware access**: Use `?.` to safely access properties of nullable objects.\n",
    "- **Null-coalescing**: Use `??` to provide default values for nullable expressions.\n",
    "- **Null-coalescing assignment**: Use `??=` to assign a value only if the variable is null.\n",
    "- **Null assertion**: Use `!` to assert that a nullable expression is not null. Use with caution.\n",
    "- **Null checks**: Check for null before using `!` to avoid runtime errors.\n",
    "- **Required parameters**: Use `required` for non-nullable named parameters to ensure they are provided.\n",

    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we covered the fundamentals of the Dart programming language:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variables and Constants**: Use `var` for type inference, explicit types for clarity, `final` for runtime constants, and `const` for compile-time constants.\n",
    "2. **Type Inference**: Dart can infer types from initial values, but explicit types improve readability and catch errors early.\n",
    "3. **Null Safety**: Dart's null safety prevents null reference errors by making types non-nullable by default. Use `?` for nullable types, `?.` for null-aware access, `??` for null-coalescing, and `!` for null assertion (use with caution).\n",
    "4. **Numbers**: Dart has `int` for integers and `double` for floating-point numbers. Supports various numeric operations and conversions.\n",
    "5. **Strings**: Immutable sequences of UTF-16 code units. Support interpolation, multiline literals, raw strings, and extensive manipulation methods.\n",
    "6. **Booleans**: `true` or `false` values. Used in conditional statements and logical operations.\n",
    "7. **Lists**: Ordered collections of objects. Support adding, removing, accessing, and transforming elements.\n",
    "8. **Maps**: Key-value associations. Support adding, removing, accessing, and transforming entries.\n",
    "9. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique objects. Support set operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand Dart fundamentals, the next chapter will cover Object-Oriented Dart in depth, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classes and objects\n",
    "- Constructors (standard, named, factory)\n",
    "- Inheritance and polymorphism\n",
    "- Abstract classes and interfaces\n",
    "- Mixins\n",
    "- Extension methods\n",
    "- Generics and type constraints\n",
    "- Enums and enhanced enums\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Next Chapter: Chapter 5 - Object-Oriented Dart**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 5 will dive deep into Dart's object-oriented programming features, covering classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, mixins, and more. You'll learn how to structure your code using OOP principles and apply these concepts to Flutter development."
