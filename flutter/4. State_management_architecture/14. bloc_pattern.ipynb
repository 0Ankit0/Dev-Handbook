    "// 3. BLoC contains all business logic\n",
    "// 4. UI is passive - it displays state and dispatches events\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unidirectional data flow**: Events go in one direction (UI \u2192 BLoC), States come out the other direction (BLoC \u2192 UI). This makes data flow predictable and debugging easier.\n",
    "- **Separation of concerns**: UI knows nothing about business logic; BLoC knows nothing about how data is displayed; Repository knows nothing about business rules.\n",
    "- **Testability**: Because BLoCs are pure Dart classes (no Flutter dependencies in core logic), they can be unit tested without widget trees.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: The same BLoC can be used across different UIs (mobile, web, desktop) because it's decoupled from the presentation layer.\n",
    "- **Predictability**: Given the same sequence of events, a BLoC always produces the same states, making the app deterministic.\n",

    "- **Events**: Plain classes (often abstract base with concrete implementations) that represent something that happened or user intention. Events flow INTO the BLoC.\n",
    "- **States**: Immutable classes that represent the UI at a specific moment. They contain all data needed to render the UI. States flow OUT of the BLoC.\n",
    "- **`extends Bloc<Event, State>`**: The BLoC class is generic over Event and State types. This provides type safety.\n",
    "- **`super(initialState)`**: The constructor must call super with the initial state that the UI should display before any events are processed.\n",
    "- **`on<EventType>()`**: Registers a handler function for a specific event type. When that event is added to the BLoC, the handler is called.\n",
    "- **`Emitter<State>`**: The `emit` function passed to handlers. It's used to output new states. You cannot emit after an `await` without the `Emitter` parameter.\n",
    "- **`emit()`**: Updates the BLoC's state and notifies all listeners. States must be emitted in response to events.\n",
    "- **Lifecycle hooks**: `onChange`, `onTransition`, and `onError` allow you to observe BLoC behavior for debugging, logging, or analytics.\n",

    "- **`BlocProvider`**: Creates and provides a BLoC to its subtree. Similar to Provider's ChangeNotifierProvider, but specifically for BLoCs. It automatically closes the BLoC when the widget is disposed.\n",
    "- **`create` callback**: Called when the BLoC is first needed. Returns the BLoC instance.\n",
    "- **`BlocBuilder<BLoC, State>`**: Widget that rebuilds when the BLoC emits new states. Takes a `builder` function that receives the current state.\n",
    "- **`buildWhen`**: Optional callback that receives previous and current state. Return `true` to rebuild, `false` to skip. Useful for optimization.\n",
    "- **`context.read<CounterBloc>()`**: Gets the BLoC instance without subscribing to changes. Use this to dispatch events in callbacks.\n",
    "- **`bloc.add(event)`**: Sends an event to the BLoC for processing. The BLoC will handle it according to registered event handlers.\n",
    "- **Multiple BlocBuilders**: You can have multiple BlocBuilders listening to the same BLoC. Each can listen to different parts of the state using `buildWhen`.\n",

    "4. **BLoC Class**: Extends `Bloc<Event, State>`. Registers event handlers with `on<EventType>()`.\n",
    "5. **Flutter Integration**:\n",
    "   - `BlocProvider`: Creates and provides BLoCs\n",
    "   - `BlocBuilder`: Rebuilds UI when state changes\n",
    "   - `BlocListener`: Handles side effects (navigation, snackbars)\n",
    "   - `BlocConsumer`: Combines builder and listener\n",
    "6. **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access. Inject repositories into BLoCs via constructor for testability.\n",
    "7. **HydratedBloc**: Automatic persistence of BLoC state across app restarts using `fromJson`/`toJson`.\n",
    "8. **Cubit**: Simplified BLoC without events. Use for simple state management.\n",
    "9. **Testing**: Use `blocTest` from bloc_test package. Mock dependencies and verify state sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep BLoCs pure (no Flutter dependencies in business logic)\n",
    "- Use immutable states with `copyWith` methods\n",
    "- Handle errors by emitting failure states\n",
    "- Use Repository pattern for data access\n",
    "- Test BLoCs with bloc_test library\n",
    "- Choose Cubit for simple features, BLoC for complex workflows\n",

    "\n",
    "Chapter 15 will explore alternative state management solutions: Redux for predictable state container architecture with unidirectional data flow, and MobX for reactive programming with observables and automatic dependency tracking. You'll learn when to choose these patterns over BLoC or Provider."
