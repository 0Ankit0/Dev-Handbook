    "\n",
    "## **Learning Objectives**\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will:\n",
    "- Configure a complete Flutter development environment for your operating system\n",
    "- Install and configure Android Studio and/or VS Code with necessary extensions\n",
    "- Set up the Android SDK and Xcode for platform-specific development\n",
    "- Configure environment variables and PATH for command-line usage\n",
    "- Create and run your first Flutter application\n",
    "- Understand the generated project structure and the purpose of each file\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.1 System Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before installation, ensure your development machine meets these specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Minimum Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Operating System**: Windows 10 (64-bit), macOS 10.14 (Mojave), or Linux (64-bit)\n",
    "- **Disk Space**: 2.5 GB (Flutter SDK) + 10 GB (Android Studio + SDK) + Xcode (macOS only)\n",
    "- **RAM**: 8 GB minimum, 16 GB recommended (Android Studio is memory-intensive)\n",
    "- **Tools**: Git for version control\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Platform-Specific Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows:**\n",
    "- PowerShell 5.0 or newer\n",
    "- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) optional but recommended for certain tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**macOS:**\n",
    "- Xcode 13 or newer (for iOS development)\n",
    "- CocoaPods (dependency manager for iOS libraries)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linux:**\n",
    "- 64-bit Intel or AMD processor\n",
    "- Additional 32-bit libraries for Android emulator support\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.2 IDE Selection: Android Studio vs. VS Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "Flutter development is officially supported on two primary IDEs. Both have identical Flutter SDK capabilities but different workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Android Studio (Recommended for Beginners)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Built-in Android emulator management\n",
    "- Visual layout editor for Android XML files (when needed)\n",
    "- Integrated Android SDK and virtual device manager\n",
    "- Built-in Git tools and database inspectors\n",
    "- Flutter-specific UI guides and wizards\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Heavier resource usage (4-8 GB RAM typical)\n",
    "- Slower startup time\n",
    "- More complex interface for beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Visual Studio Code (Recommended for Efficiency)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Lightweight and fast (< 1 GB RAM usage)\n",
    "- Extensive extension ecosystem\n",
    "- Better multi-language support (if you also do web/backend)\n",
    "- Integrated terminal\n",
    "- Faster Hot Reload triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Requires manual emulator setup (though extensions help)\n",
    "- Less visual tooling for Android-specific configurations\n",
    "- No built-in profiler tools (use DevTools separately)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recommendation:**\n",
    "Install **both**. Use Android Studio for initial setup, emulator management, and profiling. Use VS Code for day-to-day coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.3 Installing the Flutter SDK**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flutter SDK contains the Flutter engine, framework libraries, command-line tools (`flutter`, `dart`), and the `flutter` executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Download Flutter**\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and select your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative: Git Installation (Recommended)**\n",
    "This method makes updating Flutter easier (just `git pull`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Clone the stable branch of Flutter repository\n",
    "# This command downloads the Flutter SDK to your home directory\n",
    "\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable ~/development/flutter\n",
    "# Explanation:\n",
    "# git clone - Downloads a copy of the repository\n",
    "# https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git - The official Flutter repository URL\n",
    "# -b stable - Checks out the 'stable' branch (production-ready releases)\n",
    "# ~/development/flutter - Destination path (can be anywhere, but avoid paths with spaces)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Path Constraints:**\n",
    "- Do not install Flutter in a directory like `C:\\Program Files\\` (spaces in path cause issues)\n",
    "- Do not install in directories requiring elevated privileges (like root-owned Linux directories)\n",
    "- Keep the path short: `C:\\flutter` or `~/flutter` is better than deep nesting\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Add Flutter to PATH**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `flutter` command must be accessible from your terminal/command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**macOS/Linux (Zsh/Bash):**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Edit your shell configuration file\n",
    "# If using Zsh (default on macOS Catalina+):\n",
    "nano ~/.zshrc\n",
    "\n",
    "# If using Bash (older macOS or Linux):\n",
    "nano ~/.bashrc\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add this line to the end of the file:\n",
    "export PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin\"\n",
    "# $PATH keeps existing paths, appending Flutter's bin directory\n",
    "# $HOME resolves to your user directory (/Users/username on macOS, /home/username on Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the file (Ctrl+O in nano, then Enter, then Ctrl+X)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reload the configuration without restarting terminal:\n",
    "source ~/.zshrc\n",
    "# or source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify:\n",
    "which flutter\n",
    "# Should output: /Users/username/development/flutter/bin/flutter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows (PowerShell):**\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "# Open PowerShell as Administrator\n",
    "# Set the PATH for the current user (persistent)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\n",
    "    \"Path\", \n",
    "    [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(\"Path\", \"User\") + \";C:\\flutter\\bin\", \n",
    "    \"User\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "# [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable is a .NET method PowerShell can access\n",
    "# \"Path\" is the environment variable name\n",
    "# Second argument gets current Path and appends Flutter location\n",
    "# \"User\" scope means it's for your user account (not system-wide)\n",

    "## **2.4 Android Setup (All Platforms)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Android development requires the Android SDK, platform tools, and an emulator or physical device.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Installing Android Studio**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download from [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)\n",
    "2. Run the installer with default options\n",
    "3. On first launch, the **Android Studio Setup Wizard** downloads the Android SDK automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**SDK Components Required:**\n",
    "- **Android SDK Platform**: API levels you target (e.g., API 33, 34)\n",
    "- **Android SDK Command-line Tools**: For `flutter` to communicate with SDK\n",
    "- **Android SDK Build-Tools**: Compiles your code into APKs\n",
    "- **Android Emulator**: Virtual device testing\n",
    "- **Android SDK Platform-Tools**: `adb` (Android Debug Bridge), `fastboot`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Configuring Android Licenses**\n",
    "\n",
    "Flutter requires accepting Android SDK licenses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Navigate to Android SDK location and accept licenses\n",
    "# This command must be run before Flutter can build Android apps\n",
    "\n",
    "flutter doctor --android-licenses\n",
    "# This runs the Android SDK's sdkmanager with --licenses flag\n",
    "# You will see prompts like:\n",
    "# Review license android-sdk-license-cimg... [y/N]: y\n",
    "# Type 'y' and press Enter for each prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explanation of what you're accepting:\n",
    "# - Android Software Development Kit License Agreement\n",
    "# - Intel Android Extra License (for HAXM emulator acceleration)\n",
    "# - Google APIs Terms of Service\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating an Android Virtual Device (AVD)**\n",
    "\n",
    "An AVD is an emulator configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Android Studio → More Actions → Virtual Device Manager\n",
    "2. Click \"Create Device\"\n",
    "3. Select hardware (Pixel 6 API 33 is standard)\n",
    "4. Select system image (Download \"Tiramisu\" API 33 if not present)\n",
    "5. Verify configuration:\n",
    "   - Graphics: Hardware (uses your GPU for faster rendering)\n",
    "   - RAM: 2048 MB or higher\n",
    "   - Internal Storage: 2048 MB or higher\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative: Command Line AVD Creation**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# List available system images\n",
    "sdkmanager --list | grep system-images\n",
    "\n",
    "# Download a specific image\n",
    "sdkmanager \"system-images;android-33;google_apis;x86_64\"\n",

    "## **2.5 iOS Setup (macOS Only)**\n",
    "\n",
    "iOS development requires Xcode and only works on macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Installing Xcode**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download from Mac App Store or [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/download/) (faster direct download)\n",
    "2. Open Xcode → Preferences → Locations\n",
    "3. Ensure \"Command Line Tools\" is set to your Xcode version (e.g., Xcode 15.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Installing CocoaPods**\n",
    "\n",
    "CocoaPods is the dependency manager for iOS libraries (analogous to Gradle for Android):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install using RubyGems (Ruby comes pre-installed on macOS)\n",
    "sudo gem install cocoapods\n",
    "# sudo - run as administrator (required for system Ruby)\n",
    "# gem - Ruby package manager\n",
    "# install cocoapods - downloads the CocoaPods CLI tool\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup CocoaPods master repository (takes time, only run once)\n",
    "pod setup\n",
    "# This clones the CocoaPods Specs repository (~2GB)\n",
    "# It contains specifications for all iOS libraries Flutter might use\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you use M1/M2/M3 Macs (Apple Silicon), you may need:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install FFI (Foreign Function Interface) support for Apple Silicon\n",
    "sudo arch -x86_64 gem install ffi\n",
    "# arch -x86_64 runs in Rosetta 2 emulation mode\n",
    "# FFI allows Ruby (which CocoaPods uses) to call C libraries\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **iOS Simulator**\n",
    "\n",
    "The iOS Simulator comes bundled with Xcode. To open it:\n",
    "- Xcode → Open Developer Tool → Simulator\n",
    "- Or run: `open -a Simulator`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.6 Verifying Installation: flutter doctor**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `flutter doctor` command diagnoses your environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run diagnostic tool\n",
    "flutter doctor\n",
    "# or for verbose output: flutter doctor -v\n",

    "## **2.11 Chapter Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we established a complete Flutter development environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SDK Installation**: Cloned Flutter via Git, configured PATH environment variables for system-wide access to `flutter` and `dart` commands\n",
    "- **Platform Setup**: \n",
    "  - Android: Installed Android Studio, SDK command-line tools, accepted licenses, created AVD emulator\n",
    "  - iOS: Installed Xcode, configured command-line tools, installed CocoaPods for dependency management\n",
    "- **Verification**: Used `flutter doctor` to diagnose and resolve environment issues\n",
    "- **Project Structure**: Examined the multi-platform directory structure, understanding that `lib/` contains Dart code while platform directories contain native glue code\n",
    "- **Configuration**: Analyzed `pubspec.yaml` for dependency management and `main.dart` as the application entry point\n",
    "- **Execution**: Launched the default counter app using command line and IDE tools, utilizing Hot Reload for rapid iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Variables are Critical**: The `flutter` command must be in your PATH. Android development requires `ANDROID_HOME` pointing to the SDK location.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Three Trees Architecture in Practice**: When you press the '+' button in the default app, `setState()` marks the element as dirty, Flutter schedules a rebuild, creates new Text widgets (cheap), but reuses RenderObjects where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Platform Directories are for Glue**: You rarely modify `android/` and `ios/` directories. Flutter handles native builds, but you edit these when adding platform-specific plugins or permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **pubspec.yaml is Your Manifest**: It manages not just dependencies, but also assets (images, fonts), app versioning, and Dart SDK constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hot Reload is Stateful**: It preserves your app's current state (like counter value), while Hot Restart resets to initial state. Learn the difference to avoid confusion during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise: Environment Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding to Chapter 3, ensure your setup is complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run `flutter doctor` and resolve all `[✗]` and `[!]` issues until you see only green checkmarks `[✓]`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a test project and run it on:\n",
    "   - Android Emulator (if on Windows/Linux/macOS)\n",
    "   - iOS Simulator (if on macOS)\n",
    "   - Chrome (web)\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Modify the `home` property in `MaterialApp` to change the title text, perform Hot Reload (`r`), and verify the change appears instantly without losing the counter state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Examine the `android/app/build.gradle` file. Identify where the `minSdkVersion` is defined (this determines the oldest Android version your app supports).\n",
