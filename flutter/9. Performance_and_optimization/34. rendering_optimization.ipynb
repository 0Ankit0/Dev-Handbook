    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object caching**: `Paint` and `Path` objects are expensive to create. Define them as `static final` or instance fields, not inside `paint()`. The `paint()` method runs 60-120 times per second; object creation here causes GC pressure.\n",
    "- **Path caching**: Complex paths should be built once and cached. Rebuild only when input data or size changes. This avoids O(n) path construction on every frame.\n",
    "- **PictureRecorder**: For extremely complex static scenes (thousands of draw calls), record to a `Picture` object once, then draw the picture in subsequent frames. This bakes the drawing commands into a GPU-friendly format.\n",
    "- **saveLayer cost**: `canvas.saveLayer()` creates an offscreen render target (texture), draws to it, then composites. This is expensive—avoid it for simple clipping. Use `clipRect`/`clipPath` without saveLayer when possible.\n",
    "- **shouldRepaint**: Return `false` aggressively. If the visual output hasn't changed, prevent the paint phase from running entirely.\n",

    "- **Warmup timing**: Compile shaders during app startup (splash screen) or during idle time before they're needed. The `SceneBuilder` approach renders widgets offscreen to force compilation.\n",
    "- **Common culprits**: Blur effects (`BackdropFilter`, `ImageFilter.blur`), complex gradients, rounded corners with elevation (shadows), and text rendering all require unique shaders.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sliver architecture**: Unlike `ListView` which creates a box model, slivers are viewport-aware. They know exactly how much of them is visible and can skip layout/paint of offscreen portions entirely.\n",
    "- **SliverAppBar**: Efficiently collapses and expands without rebuilding the entire scroll view. Uses transform operations rather than rebuilding widgets.\n",
    "- **Custom physics**: Override `createBallisticSimulation` to control fling deceleration, spring behavior, and overscroll resistance. Lighter mass and higher damping create \"heavier\" feeling scrolls.\n",
    "- **Viewport culling**: Custom slivers can implement aggressive culling—if `constraints.remainingPaintExtent` is zero, the sliver is completely offscreen and can skip all work.\n",

    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we explored techniques to optimize the Paint phase and GPU rendering:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom Painters**: Cache `Paint` and `Path` objects as instance fields. Use `PictureRecorder` for complex static scenes. Avoid `saveLayer` unless absolutely necessary for blending.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shader Warm-up**: Pre-compile shaders during splash screen to prevent jank. Common culprits are blur effects, gradients, and shadows. Use `FadeTransition` instead of Material transitions to reduce shader variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impeller Engine**: Precompiles shaders at build time, eliminating runtime jank. Optimize for Impeller by minimizing clips and avoiding excessive opacity layers. Impeller is default on iOS in modern Flutter versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overdraw Reduction**: Avoid stacking containers that obscure each other. Use `BoxDecoration` with borders/rounded corners instead of nested widgets. Minimize `Opacity` widget usage—prefer color alpha or `FadeTransition`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Slivers**: Use `CustomScrollView` with slivers for viewport-aware rendering. Slivers skip layout/paint of offscreen content more aggressively than box-based scrolling widgets. Implement custom physics for polished scroll experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 35 will cover **Advanced Topics** including:\n",
    "- Custom widgets and render objects\n",
    "- Animation mastery (AnimationController, Hero, physics)\n",
    "- Advanced state patterns (MVVM, MVI, Clean Architecture)\n",
    "- Plugin development and federated plugins\n",
