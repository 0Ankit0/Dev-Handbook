    "- **BUILD Phase**: Occurs on the UI thread. Flutter walks the widget tree, calling `build()` methods to construct the element tree. This phase is relatively fast but can be expensive if complex logic runs inside `build()` methods.\n",
    "- **LAYOUT Phase**: Also on the UI thread. Implements the box constraint model—parents pass constraints down (e.g., \"max width: 400px\"), children calculate their size and pass it back up. Constraint violations or expensive layout calculations (like intrinsics) slow this phase.\n",
    "- **PAINT Phase**: UI thread records drawing commands into a display list (DisplayList in Impeller, SkPicture in Skia). The actual rasterization happens on a separate Raster (GPU) thread, allowing the UI thread to prepare the next frame while the GPU draws the current one.\n",
    "- **CustomPainter**: Direct access to the Paint phase. `shouldRepaint` optimization prevents unnecessary repaints when data hasn't changed.\n",

    "- **RepaintBoundary**: Creates a separate layer in the rendering tree. When a child animates (rotates, fades), only that layer repaints; parent and siblings are unaffected.\n",
    "- **Lazy builders**: `ListView.builder`, `GridView.builder`, and `PageView.builder` create children on-demand as they scroll into view. Essential for lists > 20 items.\n",
    "- **Image caching**: Specify `cacheWidth`/`cacheHeight` to downsample large images to display size. A 4000x3000 image displayed at 400x300 wastes memory and GPU time.\n",
    "- **Granular setState**: Call `setState()` in the lowest possible widget in the tree, or use state management (Provider/Riverpod) to rebuild only consuming widgets.\n",

    "## **Chapter Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we established the foundation for understanding and measuring Flutter performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Three-Phase Pipeline**: Flutter renders frames through Build (widget tree), Layout (constraints), and Paint (drawing commands) phases. All three must complete within the frame budget (16.67ms at 60fps, 8.33ms at 120fps).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Frame Budget**: Calculate budget as `1000ms / target FPS`. Exceeding the budget causes jank—visible stuttering as frames are skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Jank Sources**:\n",
    "   - **Build**: Expensive calculations, sorting, parsing in `build()` methods\n",
    "   - **Layout**: `IntrinsicHeight/Width`, unbounded constraints, complex flex layouts\n",
    "   - **Paint**: Shader compilation, complex paths, excessive `saveLayer`, large images\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DevTools Profiling**: Use Performance view (Timeline) to visualize frame timing. Look for long bars in the UI thread lane. Enable Repaint Rainbow to visualize unnecessary repaints.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Programmatic Tracking**: Use `SchedulerBinding.instance.addTimingsCallback` to log frame timing in production builds or automated tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Foundational Best Practices**: Use `const` constructors, `RepaintBoundary` for animations, lazy builders for lists, pre-compute expensive operations outside `build()`, and optimize images with explicit dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 32 will dive deeper into **Build Optimization**:\n",
    "- const constructors and widget immutability patterns\n",
    "- const literals and compile-time constants\n",
    "- RepaintBoundary usage and layer optimization\n",
    "- Avoiding unnecessary rebuilds with Selector and Consumer\n",
    "- ListView.builder and lazy loading patterns\n",
